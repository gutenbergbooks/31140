<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Young Auctioneers&rdquo; forms the initial
volume of a line of juvenile stories called &ldquo;The
Working Upward Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tale is complete in itself, and tells of the adventures
of a homeless, although not a penniless
youth, who strikes up an acquaintanceship with
another young fellow experienced as an auctioneer.
The two purchase a horse and wagon, stock up with
goods, and take to the road. The partners pass
through a number of more or less trying experiences,
and the younger lad is continually on the lookout for
his father, who has broken out of an asylum while
partly deranged in mind over the loss of his wife and
his fortune.</p>
<p>I have endeavored in this tale to give a faithful
picture of life among a certain class of traveling
salesmen who are but little known to the world at
large, especially to those who inhabit our large cities.
In country places the traveling auctioneer is looked
for as a matter of course, and he is treated according
to the humor of the inhabitants, or rather, according
to the merits or demerits of the &ldquo;bargains&rdquo; offered
on a previous trip.</p>
<p>I sincerely trust that my numerous boy readers
will find the tale to their liking, and that the moral&mdash;to
lead an upright, honest life under any and all
circumstances&mdash;will not escape them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>MATT ATTENDS A SALE.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ladies and gentlemen, what am I offered for
this elegant vase, imported direct from Italy, a most
marvelous piece of workmanship, worth every cent
of twenty-five dollars? Who will start it at five
dollars? Start it at four? Start it at three? At
two? At one dollar? What is that&mdash;fifty cents?
Rather low, lady, but as I said before, these goods
must be sold, regardless of the prices obtained.
Fifty cents, it is! Fifty&mdash;fifty! Who will make it
one dollar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, only sixty? Well, well, well! Never
mind, the goods must go, and sixty cents is better
than nothing. Sixty&mdash;sixty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;One dollar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last I am offered one dollar! Think of it!
One dollar for a beautiful vase such as might well
adorn the home of a Gould, or a Vanderbilt! But
such is life. One dollar&mdash;one dollar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One and a quarter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One and a half!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One and a half is offered! Oh, what a shame,
ladies and gentlemen; a paltry dollar and a half for
an article worth, at the very lowest estimate, twenty-five
dollars. Who makes it two dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two and a half!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three and a quarter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three and a quar&mdash; Ah, four dollars? Four
dollars! Who says five? Going at four&mdash;at four&mdash;at
four. Four and a half&mdash;four and a quarter&mdash;this
is your last chance, remember. Did you say five,
sir? No? Well, four it is, then. Going&mdash;going&mdash;the
last chance, ladies and gentlemen! Going&mdash;going&mdash;gone,
to the lady in the brown dress, Andrew,
for four dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene was a small store on Nassau street near
Fulton street, in New York City. Outside of the
open doorway hung a red flag, indicative of an auction
sale. The single window of the place was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
crowded with vases, imitation marble statues, plated
tableware, and gorgeous lamps of highly-polished
metal.</p>
<p>Among these articles was a sign in black letters
on white cardboard bearing these words:</p>
<p class='sign center'>ROYAL CONSIGNMENT AUCTION CO.,<br />
Sales Daily from 10 <span class='smcaplc'>A.M.</span> to 3 <span class='smcaplc'>P.M.</span></p>
<p>Inside, toward the rear, there was a small raised
platform, and upon this stood the auctioneer, a tall,
thin-faced man, with sharp black eyes, and rather a
squeaky voice. To one side was his assistant, a
much younger and much more pleasant-looking individual,
who wrapped up the articles sold and collected
for them.</p>
<p>It was between twelve and one o&rsquo;clock in the day,
and the auction store was crowded with business
people, who, during their lunch-time, had dropped
in to see what was going on, and, possibly, make a
purchase. There were middle-aged business men,
young clerks, and several young ladies, and all appeared
interested in the mild excitement attending
the disposal of the goods.</p>
<p>Among the young people present was a boy of
fifteen, whose clothing, although not of a fashionable
cut, was, nevertheless, neat and clean. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
dark curly hair, and his face was as honest in
appearance as it was fearless and handsome.</p>
<p>The youth was as much interested in the sale as
though he was buying half the articles auctioned
off, although he had not enough in his trousers
pocket to even start bidding, for no bid of less than
twenty-five cents was recognized by the auctioneer
in beginning a sale.</p>
<p>The vase disposed of, the auctioneer&rsquo;s assistant
brought forth from a side shelf a piece of imitation
marble statuary, representing three doves bearing a
wreath of flowers between them. The bit of bric-a-brac
looked quite nice, but as it was but imitation
marble, it was not worth more than two dollars, if
as much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, here we have as fine a piece of Italian
marble as was ever brought to New York,&rdquo; began
the auctioneer, holding up the piece in question.
&ldquo;And the work upon it cannot to-day be excelled
by any sculptors on this side of the Atlantic. How
beautiful are those three doves, and how natural
that wreath! Examine the piece for yourselves,
ladies and gentlemen. It is genuine Italian marble,
and will not go to pieces in your hands. There you
are, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bit of statuary was handed to a gentleman
who stood directly in front of the auctioneer. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
gave it a hasty glance and then started to hand it
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass it through the crowd, please. I want every
one to be convinced of its quality before I attempt
to sell it!&rdquo; bawled the auctioneer, and the gentleman
handed it to the man next to him.</p>
<p>Thus started, the bit of bric-a-brac traveled from
one hand to another until it reached a heavy-set man
with red mustache, who stood but a couple of yards
from the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered the man, as he turned over
the article in contempt. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give a dollar
a cartload for them. Here you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he finished, he thrust the piece of bric-a-brac
toward a young lady who had just entered. She
drew back in surprise, not knowing what his action
meant. The statuary left the man&rsquo;s hand, touched
the young lady&rsquo;s arm, and then fell to the floor with
a crash, and was broken into a dozen pieces.</p>
<p>The young lady uttered a slight shriek of surprise
at the accident, and instantly the crowd looked
toward her, and then at the auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, who broke that?&rdquo; demanded the auctioneer,
in an entirely different tone of voice, as he left
his stand and hurried to the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young lady,&rdquo; replied a fellow who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
not seen the movements of the man with the red
mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! I did not do it!&rdquo; cried the young
lady, shrinking back. &ldquo;I did not touch the piece,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but it&rsquo;s right at your feet, madam; you
must have let it fall,&rdquo; said the auctioneer harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who did, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who ran out as soon as the statuary was
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! It isn&rsquo;t likely a man would run
away like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady speaks the truth, sir,&rdquo; put in
the boy previously mentioned. &ldquo;The man shoved
the statue toward her, and when she drew back it
slipped from his hand to the floor. She was not in
the least responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that, Matt Lincoln,&rdquo; said the
young lady, with a grateful nod. &ldquo;I shall not forget
this service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Miss Bartlett,&rdquo; returned the
boy, blushing. &ldquo;I like to be of service to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You evidently seem to know this young lady?&rdquo;
said the auctioneer, turning to Matt Lincoln.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; she is the stenographer at our office.
That&rsquo;s how I came to notice her when she came in.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder you try to shield her!&rdquo; sneered the
auctioneer. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t afford to let this matter
pass. You will have to pay for the damages done,
madam. The cost price of that piece of bric-a-brac
was ten dollars, but I&rsquo;ll throw off two dollars and
call it eight.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>A LIVELY DISCUSSION.</h3>
</div>
<p>At the intimation that she must pay eight dollars,
the face of the young lady stenographer grew pale,
while that of Matt Lincoln flushed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I cannot pay the money!&rdquo; gasped Ida Bartlett.
&ldquo;I have no such amount with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a swindle!&rdquo; burst in Matt Lincoln indignantly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you pay a cent. Miss Bartlett. It
was not your fault, and he cannot force you to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut right up!&rdquo; snarled the auctioneer, turning
to Matt fiercely. &ldquo;Unless you want to get yourself
into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t shut up and see this young lady ill-treated!&rdquo;
retorted Matt, flushing still more. &ldquo;You
may think you can ride over me, but you can&rsquo;t do
it. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Matt!&rdquo; pleaded the stenographer, catching
him by the arm. &ldquo;Do not say anything rash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Miss Bartlett, this chap wants to force you
into paying for something you didn&rsquo;t do! I wouldn&rsquo;t
stand it! I&rsquo;d fight him first!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You would, would you?&rdquo; growled the auctioneer,
his face growing dark and sour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would!&rdquo; retorted the boy defiantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that boy&rsquo;s game!&rdquo; laughed a bystander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a regular little bantam,&rdquo; replied another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle with you in a minute,&rdquo; said the auctioneer,
finding he could not silence Matt. &ldquo;Now,
madam, do you intend to pay for the damage done
or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not do the damage, and I cannot see how
you can ask me to pay,&rdquo; faltered Ida Bartlett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have proof that you let the piece of bric-a-brac
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chap who says he saw her drop it had his
back turned at the time,&rdquo; put in Matt, and turning
to the individual in question, he added: &ldquo;Can you
swear that you saw the piece of statuary leave her
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no, I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; returned the fellow
slowly. &ldquo;But it went down at her feet, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imagined the rest,&rdquo; finished Matt. &ldquo;I told
you so,&rdquo; he went on triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here; you shut up,&rdquo; cried the auctioneer,
losing his temper. &ldquo;Dilks, come here and help
me,&rdquo; he went on, appealing to the assistant he had
before called Andrew.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>The assistant auctioneer came forward upon this.
His face wore a troubled look, as if he did not relish
the duty he was called upon to perform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there is some mistake here, Mr.
Gulligan,&rdquo; he said in a low tone, meant only for the
auctioneer&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some mistake!&rdquo; howled Caleb Gulligan, for
such was the auctioneer&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make
mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the man run out as soon as the statuary
was broken, and by his manner I am sure he must
be the guilty party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Andrew Dilks, who is running this
establishment?&rdquo; stormed Caleb Gulligan wrathfully.
&ldquo;I lay the accident at the door of the
young woman, and, as the man is gone, she will
pay the bill&mdash;or take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The assistant auctioneer flushed up at these
words. It was plain to see that he was an honest
young man, and did not like such underhand work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she hasn&rsquo;t the money to pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she must take the consequences,&rdquo; replied
the auctioneer sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; put in Matt, who had overheard
the best part of the conversation between Caleb
Gulligan and his assistant. &ldquo;Miss Bartlett, if I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
you I wouldn&rsquo;t stay here another minute,&rdquo; he went
on to the stenographer, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what would you do?&rdquo; she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skip out. They haven&rsquo;t any right to make you
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Matt, that would not be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; go ahead. You haven&rsquo;t any friend
here but me. Mr. Fenton wouldn&rsquo;t help you any,
even if you ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady stood still for a moment, and
then made a sudden movement for the doorway.
Caleb Gulligan rushed after her, only to find Matt
Lincoln barring his progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of my way, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; queried Matt coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rat! Out of my way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The auctioneer placed his hand upon the boy&rsquo;s
arm, with the intention of hurling him aside. But,
strange to say, although he was taller than the
youth, he could not budge the latter for several seconds,
and by that time the young lady had disappeared,
swallowed up in the noonday crowd which
surged past the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see what you have done!&rdquo; stormed Caleb
Gulligan wrathfully. &ldquo;You have aided that young
woman to escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I meant to do,&rdquo; returned Matt,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
with a coolness that would have been exasperating
to even a less sensitive man than the crusty
auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall hold you responsible for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you do,&rdquo; was Matt&rsquo;s dogged reply.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my friend, and I always stick up for my
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this last remark there was a low murmur of
approval from those gathered about. Evidently,
the boy&rsquo;s unpolished but honest manner had won
considerable admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that I can have you locked up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For aiding her to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she have a right to hurry away if she
wanted to go? It&rsquo;s almost one o&rsquo;clock&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to
be off myself soon, if I want to keep my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a laugh at this, and half a dozen looked
at their watches and left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; put in the assistant nervously.
&ldquo;Had we not better go on with the sales? The
crowd will be gone before long. We might make
more than what was lost here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, go on with the sales,&rdquo; howled Caleb
Gulligan. &ldquo;I will take care of this young rascal,
and find out what has become of that young woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that man,&rdquo; began the assistant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the man; the young woman shall
pay for the damage done, and she can fix it up with
the man afterward, if she wishes. I am not going
to stand the loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you are making an awful row
over a fifteen-cent piece of plaster-of-paris,&rdquo; said
Matt to Gulligan, as Andrew Dilks turned toward
the auctioneer&rsquo;s stand. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you ask me to
pay for the stuff and done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plaster-of-paris!&rdquo; cried the auctioneer wrathfully.
&ldquo;That is real Italian marble&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made in Centre street,&rdquo; interrupted Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is worth every cent of ten dollars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten dollars a carload, you mean,&rdquo; went on the
boy. &ldquo;Come, let go of me; I&rsquo;ve got to go to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to the Tombs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I have done nothing wrong, and I
want you to let go of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt began to struggle, much to the delight of the
spectators, who refused to listen to what the assistant
auctioneer might have to say from the stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you a lesson!&rdquo; fumed Caleb Gulligan.
&ldquo;How do you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung Matt around and caught him by the
throat and the collar. But only for an instant was
he able to hold the boy in that fashion. Matt
squirmed and twisted like an eel, and suddenly gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the old auctioneer a push which sent him sprawling
upon his back. Before Caleb Gulligan could recover,
Matt was out of the door and running like a deer up
Nassau street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! stop him!&rdquo; roared the old auctioneer.
&ldquo;He must not get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him yourself, then,&rdquo; said one of the bystanders
heartlessly. &ldquo;We have nothing to do with
your quarrel with the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in league with him,&rdquo; fumed Caleb Gulligan,
as he scrambled to his feet. &ldquo;But, never
mind, I&rsquo;ll catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran out of the auction store and gazed perplexedly
up and down into the crowd. It was
useless. Matt Lincoln, like his friend, Ida Bartlett,
had disappeared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING OF THE PAST.</h3>
</div>
<p>Matt Lincoln did not stop until he reached Temple
Court, as that large office-building on the corner
of Nassau and Beekman streets is called. Then he
drew a long breath as he took a stand in one corner
of a side corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I&rsquo;ve put my foot into it again, I suppose,&rdquo;
he said, somewhat dismally. &ldquo;I reckon old
Uncle Dan was right, I&rsquo;m the rolling stone that&rsquo;s
forever getting into a hole and out without settling
anywhere. But I couldn&rsquo;t stand it to see Miss
Bartlett threatened. It wasn&rsquo;t a fair thing to do,
and that auctioneer ought to be run out of the city.
I suppose he&rsquo;ll be after my scalp now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Lincoln was sixteen years of age. For the
past two years he had been depending entirely upon
himself, and during that time he had, indeed, been
a rolling stone, although not entirely without an
object.</p>
<p>Up to his tenth year Matt had lived with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
father and mother in the Harlem district of the
great metropolis. He had attended one of the
public schools, and, take it all in all, had been a
happy boy.</p>
<p>Then came a cloud over the Lincoln home. Mr.
Lincoln was interested, as a speculator, in some
mines in Montana, and by a peculiar manipulation
of the stocks of these mines he lost every dollar of
his hard-earned savings. He was an over-sensitive
man, and these losses preyed upon his mind until
he was affected mentally, and had to be sent to an
asylum.</p>
<p>For several months Mrs. Lincoln and Matt paid
weekly visits to the asylum to see the father and
husband, and they were beginning to rejoice over
the thought that Mr. Lincoln would soon be himself
once more, when one day Mrs. Lincoln fell
down in the middle of Broadway, and a heavily-loaded
truck passed directly over her chest.</p>
<p>When the poor woman was picked up it was
found she was unconscious. An ambulance was at
once summoned, and she was conveyed to one of
the city hospitals. Here Matt visited her, and
listened to her last words of love and advice. She
died before sunrise the next day, and three days
later was buried.</p>
<p>If his mother&rsquo;s unexpected death was a shock to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
poor Matt, it was even more of a one to Mr. Lincoln.
Again was the father and husband&rsquo;s mind
unbalanced; this time far worse than ever before.
He escaped from the asylum, made a dramatic appearance
at the home during the burial services,
and then disappeared, no one knew where.</p>
<p>Matt&rsquo;s only remaining relative at this time was
his Uncle Dan, a brother to Mr. Lincoln. He took
charge of Matt, and took the boy to his home in
Bridgeport, Connecticut. At the same time a diligent
search for Mr. Lincoln was begun.</p>
<p>The search for Matt&rsquo;s father was unsuccessful,
although continued for several weeks. It was
learned that he had boarded a train in Jersey
City bound for Philadelphia, but there all trace of
his whereabouts was lost.</p>
<p>Matt lived with his Uncle Dan for four years.
He went to school in Bridgeport part of the time,
and when not learning, could be found at Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s
ship chandlery, a large place, situated down
near the docks.</p>
<p>It would seem that the tragic occurrences through
which he had passed would have made Matt melancholy
and low-spirited, but such was not the case.
Mrs. Lincoln had naturally been of a light heart,
and the boy partook of much of his mother&rsquo;s disposition.
He loved a free-and-easy life, loved to roam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
from place to place. With a captain who was a
friend of Uncle Dan, he had made a trip to Bangor
and Augusta, and he had likewise put in two weeks
at a lumber camp in Maine, and a month during
the summer at a hotel among the White Mountains,
doing odd jobs for the proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rolling stone and nothing less,&rdquo; Uncle Dan
had called him, over and over again, and the title
seemed to fit Matt exactly.</p>
<p>At length, when Matt was fourteen years old,
Uncle Dan Lincoln, who was then an elderly man,
was taken with pneumonia, and died two weeks
later. His wife, a crabbed woman, who detested
Matt, and was glad when he was out of the house,
at once sold out the chandlery, and went to live
with her folks in a small village in Vermont. Thus
Matt was thrown out upon his own resources with
no capital but a ten dollar bill, which his Uncle Dan
had quietly slipped into his hand only a few days
before the end.</p>
<p>Matt remained around Bridgeport but two days
after his uncle&rsquo;s funeral. Then he struck up a bargain
with the captain of a schooner which was
loaded with freight for Philadelphia, and sailed for
that city.</p>
<p>When no trace of Matt&rsquo;s father could be found
the detectives who had been put on the case declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
their belief that the poor man had drowned
himself in the Delaware River. This belief was
strengthened when some clothing that looked like
that which the demented man had worn was found
in a secluded spot not far from the river bank.</p>
<p>But Matt could not bring himself to believe that
his father was dead. There was a hope in his breast
which amounted almost to a conviction that some
day he would again find his parent, alive and well.</p>
<p>Yet Matt&rsquo;s search in and around Philadelphia,
lasting several months, was unsuccessful. His money
was soon spent, and then he started to tramp from
Philadelphia to his former home, New York.</p>
<p>This tramp, of about one hundred miles by the
various turnpikes through New Jersey, took the boy
just one week, and when he arrived in the metropolis,
both his clothing and his shoes were considerably
worn. But he brushed up, and lost no time in
hunting up work, knowing that it would never do
to remain idle.</p>
<p>For two days Matt was without employment.
Then he thought of the man who had sold his father
the mining shares, Mr. Randolph Fenton, and he
paid the stock-broker a visit at his offices, on Broad
street, just off of Wall street.</p>
<p>As it happened, Randolph Fenton was just then
in need of a boy to run errands and do copying, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
after a talk with Matt, he hired him at a salary of
four dollars a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you in because I thought so much of
your dear father,&rdquo; explained Randolph Fenton.
&ldquo;We were great friends, you must know, and I feel
it my duty to do something for his son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randolph Fenton spoke very nicely, but Matt
soon found that he was by no means the kind-hearted
gentleman he wished to appear. In reality,
he was very mean and close. He worked his clerks
almost to death, and such a thing as a raise in salary
was unknown in the office.</p>
<p>But Matt found it would do no good to complain.
Times were just then somewhat hard, and another
place was not easy to obtain. He decided to make
the most of it until times grew better, and in this
resolve remained with Randolph Fenton week after
week until the opening of this story.</p>
<p>Matt had been sent by Randolph Fenton on an
errand to Temple Court, to be done as soon as the
boy had finished lunch. Waiting for another
minute to make certain that he was not being followed,
the boy hurried to one of the elevators, and
was lifted to the third floor.</p>
<p>The errand was quickly transacted, and with
several books under his arm for his employer, Matt
started on the return to the offices in Broad street.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>Not wishing to be seen in the vicinity of the
auction store, Matt turned down Park Row instead
of Nassau street, and so continued down Broadway,
his intention being to pass through Wall to Broad.</p>
<p>He had just reached the corner of Fulton street
when some one tapped him upon the shoulder, and
turning, he found himself confronted by Andrew
Dilks, the old auctioneer&rsquo;s assistant.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>AN INTERESTING PROPOSITION.</h3>
</div>
<p>On catching sight of Andrew Dilks Matt&rsquo;s first
thought was to break and run. But a second look
into the old auctioneer&rsquo;s assistant&rsquo;s face assured him
that no immediate harm was meant, and he stood
his ground, his eyes flashing, defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect us to meet quite so soon, did
you?&rdquo; remarked Andrew Dilks with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Matt bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you were doing your best to keep out
of the way of Gulligan and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Gulligan the man I had the row with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are right. I don&rsquo;t want to get into
trouble for nothing. That young lady was not to
blame for what happened, and I considered it my
duty to take her part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gulligan was very mad,&rdquo; went on Andrew
Dilks, still smiling quietly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that. He ought not to have pitched
into me the way he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, so quietly but firmly spoken,
Matt&rsquo;s eyes opened in wonder. Was it possible that
the old auctioneer&rsquo;s assistant took his part?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You agree with me?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I agree with you. Gulligan was altogether
too hasty&mdash;he most generally is,&rdquo; returned
Andrew Dilks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you don&rsquo;t dare tell him that,&rdquo; and Matt
grinned mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I believe that unknown man was entirely
to blame. It was a shame the way Gulligan carried
on. As soon as you ran out he turned upon me for
not stopping you, and we had some pretty hot
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Matt. &ldquo;I must thank
you, not only for myself, but for Miss Bartlett as
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those hot words have cost me my situation,&rdquo;
went on Andrew Dilks more soberly.</p>
<p>Instantly Matt&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad, indeed, it is!&rdquo; he said earnestly.
&ldquo;Why, I would rather have gone home and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
got the money to pay for the broken stuff than have
that happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not altogether on account of the broken
piece of bric-a-brac,&rdquo; went on Andrew Dilks.
&ldquo;Gulligan has been angry at me for over two weeks&mdash;ever
since I wouldn&rsquo;t pass off a counterfeit five-dollar
bill he had taken in. I said the bill ought to
be burned up, but he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now you are out of a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. But I don&rsquo;t much care. Working
for him was not easy, and he never paid me my
weekly wages of ten dollars until I had asked for it
about a dozen times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought auctioneers made more than that,&rdquo;
said Matt. There was something about Andrew
Dilks that pleased him, and he was becoming interested
in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them do&mdash;a good deal more. But
Gulligan considered that he had taught me the
business, and that I was still under his thumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go in business for yourself?
It seems to me it would just suit me,&rdquo; said Matt
enthusiastically. &ldquo;I once passed through the town
of Rahway, out in New Jersey, and a fellow not
much older than you had a big wagon there, and
was auctioning stuff off at a great rate&mdash;crockery
ware, lamps, albums, razors, and a lot more of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
goods. They said he had been selling goods there
every night for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the fellows who make money,&rdquo; returned
Andrew Dilks. &ldquo;Here in the city the business is
done to death. Give a man a good team of horses
and a wagon, and enough money to stock up, and
he can travel from place to place and make a small
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you. Why don&rsquo;t you start out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t enough money, that&rsquo;s the only
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would it take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price of the turnout, from two hundred
dollars up, and about a hundred dollars for stock.
You know stock can be purchased as often as
desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By crickety! If I had the money I would go
in with you!&rdquo; cried Matt, caught with a sudden idea.
&ldquo;That sort of thing would just suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You? Why I thought you were a city boy, a clerk&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am. But my Uncle Dan always called me
a rolling stone, and that hits it exactly. I am tired
of New York, and I would jump at the first chance
to get out of it and see some of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are like me,&rdquo; returned Andrew Dilks
warmly. He was quite taken with Matt&rsquo;s candor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
&ldquo;If I had a turnout I would travel all over the
United States, stopping a week here and a week
there. How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am twenty-one. Do you live with your
parents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am alone here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. I used to live in Chicago before all
my folks died. I like your appearance. What is
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt told him, and also gave Andrew Dilks a
brief bit of his history. The auctioneer listened
with interest, and then told a number of things concerning
himself. He had been with Caleb Gulligan
four years. He had been sick several times, but,
nevertheless, had managed to save a hundred and
thirty-five dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got seventy-five dollars saved, part of
which I got from other brokers than Mr. Fenton,
for running errands, and so forth,&rdquo; said Matt.
&ldquo;That and your money would make two hundred
and ten dollars. Couldn&rsquo;t we start out on that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might,&rdquo; replied Andrew Dilks reflectively.
&ldquo;You are on your way to work now, are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I ought to be at the office this minute!&rdquo;
cried Matt, with a start. &ldquo;Mr. Fenton will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
tearing mad, I know. But I won&rsquo;t care&mdash;that is, if
we come to a deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see me this evening, then. I am
stopping at the Columbus Hotel, on the Bowery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the place, and I&rsquo;ll be up at seven
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; returned Matt; and on this agreement the
two separated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but I would like to become a traveling
auctioneer!&rdquo; said the boy to himself, as he hurried
down Broadway. &ldquo;I wish I had enough money so
that we could go in as equal partners. He seems a
first-rate chap in every way, and honest, too, or he
would not have gotten into that row over the five-dollar
counterfeit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt had lost much time in talking to Andrew
Dilks, and now, in order to reach Wall street the
quicker, he hopped upon the tail-end of a dray that
was moving rapidly toward the Battery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beating the cable cars out of a nickel!&rdquo; he
called to the driver, and that individual smiled
grimly, and said nothing.</p>
<p>Less than ten minutes later the boy entered the
stock-broker&rsquo;s main office. He was just about to
pass into Randolph Fenton&rsquo;s private apartment
when the figure of a man moving rapidly down the
street attracted his attention. It was the red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
mustached man who had created the trouble at the
auction store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please give these books to Mr. Fenton, and tell
him I&rsquo;ll be back shortly,&rdquo; said Matt to the head clerk,
and without waiting for a reply he placed his package
on a desk, and hurried out of the door after the
man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>MATT IS DISCHARGED.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Matt Lincoln reached the pavement he
saw that the man he was after had reached Wall
street and was turning down toward Water street.
The boy started on a run and caught up to the individual
just as he was about to descend into an insurance
office which was located several steps below
the level of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there!&rdquo; cried Matt, and he caught the
man by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, boy?&rdquo; demanded the other, with a
slight start at being accosted so unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see you about that piece of bric-a-brac
you broke at the auction store up on Nausau street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face reddened, and he looked confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t know what you are talking
about,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; returned Matt coolly. &ldquo;You
tried to let the blame fall on a young lady, but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
won&rsquo;t work. You must go back, explain matters,
and settle up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind!&rdquo; blustered the red
mustached man. He had recovered from his first
alarm. &ldquo;I know nothing of the affair you have in
mind. I have not been near an auction store to-day&mdash;for
a month, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a whopper!&rdquo; exploded Matt. &ldquo;You
were in the place less than an hour and a half
ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, boy, you have got hold of the wrong
man. Let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much I won&rsquo;t! You are the man, and you
can&rsquo;t fool me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t let go I&rsquo;ll call a policeman just as
sure as my name is Paul Carden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what your name is, you&rsquo;ve got to
go back and set matters straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man glared at Matt for a moment. Then,
without warning, he pushed the boy backward.
Matt was standing upon the edge of the steps
leading to the insurance office at the time, and he
went down with a crash into the wire-netting door,
knocking a large hole into it.</p>
<p>Before Matt could recover the man darted down
Wall street and around the nearest corner. Matt
would have gone after him, but the proprietor of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
the insurance office came out, and demanded to
know what he meant by bursting the wire-netting
door in such a rude fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man knocked me down the steps,&rdquo; Matt
explained. &ldquo;I hope the door isn&rsquo;t ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, but there&rsquo;s a hole in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wire has broken from under the molding,
that is all,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Let me see if I can&rsquo;t
fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought out his penknife, and loosened part
of the molding. Then drawing the wire back into
place, he tacked the molding fast again; and the
door was as good as before.</p>
<p>But all this had taken time, and Matt knew it
would now be useless to attempt to follow Paul
Carden. He looked around the corner, and seeing
nothing of the fellow, retraced his steps to Randolph
Fenton&rsquo;s establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world have you been so long?&rdquo;
demanded Mr. Fenton, as Matt entered the private
apartment. &ldquo;Here I have been waiting an hour for
you to deliver a message to Ulmer &amp; Grant. I hire
you to be on hand when wanted, Lincoln; not to
loaf your time away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not loafing my time away, Mr. Fenton,&rdquo;
returned Matt calmly. &ldquo;There was a private matter
I had to attend to, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You have no business to attend to private matters
during office hours!&rdquo; roared Randolph Fenton
wrathfully. &ldquo;You will mind my business and nothing
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this could not wait. There was a man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care for your explanations, young man.
Too much time has already been wasted. Take this
message to Ulmer &amp; Grant&rsquo;s, and bring a reply inside
of ten minutes, or consider yourself discharged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with his face full of wrath and sourness,
Randolph Fenton thrust a sealed envelope into
Matt&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>An angry reply arose to the boy&rsquo;s lips. But he
checked it, and without a word left the office and
hurried away on his errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I make a satisfactory arrangement with
Andrew Dilks,&rdquo; said Matt to himself. &ldquo;It is growing
harder and harder every day to get along with
Mr. Fenton. Every time he talks he acts as if he
wanted to snap somebody&rsquo;s head off. Poor Miss
Bartlett at her desk looked half-scared to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving at the offices of Ulmer &amp; Grant, Matt
found that Mr. Ulmer had gone to Boston. Mr.
Grant was busy, but would give him an answer in a
few minutes.</p>
<p>Matt sat down, wondering what Mr. Fenton
would say about the delay. Ten, fifteen, twenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
minutes passed. At last Mr. Grant was at liberty,
but it was exactly half an hour before Matt managed
to gain a reply to the message he carried.</p>
<p>When Matt got back to Randolph Fenton&rsquo;s office
he found the broker in his private apartment alone,
and almost purple with suppressed rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it smart to keep me waiting, I suppose?&rdquo;
he sneered, as he took Mr. Grant&rsquo;s message
and tore it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not my fault. Mr. Ulmer is away, and
Mr. Grant was busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let Mr. Grant know I was in a
hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clerk said he was not to be disturbed just
then, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more explanations, Lincoln. I took you
into this office more for the sake of your poor
father than for anything else. But you have not
endeavored to make the most of your chances&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done my work, and more,&rdquo; interrupted
Matt bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! don&rsquo;t contradict me, young man! You
are more of an idler than aught else. This noon
you wasted an hour on that errand to Temple
Court, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fenton,&rdquo; interrupted a voice from the doorway,
and looking up the stock-broker saw Ida
Bartlett standing there.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; snapped the broker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, I would like to say a word
in Matthew&rsquo;s behalf,&rdquo; went on the stenographer
timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use saying anything, Miss Bartlett,&rdquo; put
in Matt hastily. &ldquo;Mr. Fenton won&rsquo;t listen to any
explanations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; went on Matt in a whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to stand it any longer,&rdquo; and then he
added, as the stock-broker&rsquo;s attention was arrested
by the reply Mr. Grant had sent. &ldquo;I am ready to
leave anyway, if he discharges me, and you will
only get into trouble if you mention that auction-store
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was all my fault&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t, and please keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you are discharged, Matt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something else in view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you to say, Miss Bartlett?&rdquo;
asked Randolph Fenton, tearing up the message
and throwing the pieces into the waste basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was going to say that I was partly to blame
for his being behind time this noon. I was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not try to shield him, Miss Bartlett. I
know him better than you do. He is a very lazy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
and heedless boy, and I have already made up my
mind what I am going to do in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Matt, although he felt
pretty certain of what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shall be your last day of service in these
offices. This afternoon I will pay you what is due
you, and to-morrow I will endeavor to get a boy
who is willing to attend to business and not fritter
away his time on the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not frittered away my time,&rdquo; replied
Matt warmly. &ldquo;And I feel certain you will not
get any one to do more than I have done. You
expect a boy to do two men&rsquo;s work for a boy&rsquo;s
pay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I have finished, sir. I am perfectly
willing to leave, even though times are dull, and
have been contemplating such a step on my own
account for some time. I was getting tired of being
a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You outrageous imp! Not another word from
you. I will not have you in this place another
minute! Go to Mr. Gaston and draw your pay
and leave, and never let me see your face again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And white with passion, Randolph Fenton sprang
to his feet and threw open the door for Matt to
pass out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>A BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP.</h3>
</div>
<p>Mr. Randolph Fenton&rsquo;s voice had been raised to
its highest pitch, and thus the attention of every
one in the offices had been attracted to what was
going on.</p>
<p>Ida Bartlett again came forward to speak in
Matt&rsquo;s behalf, but ere she could say a word the boy
put up his hand warningly, and turned to the book-keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take what is due me, Mr. Gaston,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaston, a somewhat elderly man, nodded,
and without a word, turned to his desk and passed
over to Matt two new one-dollar bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my boy, it isn&rsquo;t more,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he
went on, turning to the other office workers. And
with a smile and a bow to Ida Bartlett, he passed
out of the place.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></div>
<p>Not until he was some distance away did he draw
a deep breath. Somehow he felt as if he had just
emerged from a prison cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder to me that I stood it so long,&rdquo; he
muttered to himself. &ldquo;Mr. Fenton is a regular
tyrant, and ought to move to Russia. How poor
father ever came to invest in those mining shares
through him is a mystery to me.&rdquo; Matt gave a
sigh, and for an instant an unusually sober look
crossed his handsome face. &ldquo;If only I could learn
what became of poor father&mdash;if I could make sure
whether he was alive or dead&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t care how
other matters went. I must continue my searching
as soon as I can afford to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt boarded with a private family on Third
avenue, and having nothing else to do, he walked
slowly to the place. He wished he might meet the
man with the red mustache or Andrew Dilks, but
he saw nothing of either. When he arrived at the
boarding-house it was still an hour to supper-time.
He ascended to his roam and spent the time in looking
over his wardrobe, for Matt was handy with a
needle, and disliked to have buttons off or rent
seams in his garments.</p>
<p>At length the bell for supper rang, and washing
up and combing his hair, he went below. He ate
his portion leisurely, and was just finishing when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
the landlady said there was a young lady to see him
in the parlor.</p>
<p>Matt at once thought of Ida Bartlett, who lived
but a few blocks away, with her two sisters and her
mother. He was right; it was the young lady
stenographer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not wait, Matt, and so came over just as
soon as we had tea,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I want you
to tell me what you are going to do, now you are
out of Mr. Fenton&rsquo;s offices. You spoke of having
something else in view. I trust it is something
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell as to that yet,&rdquo; returned the boy,
and then sitting down beside her on the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
he told her of Andrew Dilks and the auctioneer&rsquo;s
proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if it might be quite a good
thing,&rdquo; said Ida Bartlett, when he had finished.
&ldquo;You are sure this Dilks is no sharper? There are
lots of sharpers in the auction business, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the one who tried to make you pay?&rdquo;
laughed Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, I thought of that. But
Dilks doesn&rsquo;t look like a sharper; quite the contrary.
Of course, I&rsquo;ll have to keep my eyes open. We will
have a written agreement, and I will not let the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
outfit go out of my sight, at least not until I know
him thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I think you will be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible that we may not come to any
agreement. He has more money than I. He may
want somebody who can put up an equal amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred and thirty-five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is a good deal more than you have, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have saved seventy-five dollars,&rdquo; returned
Matt, and not without some pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible! And on a salary of four dollars
a week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! That salary only paid my way. I
saved the money out of extras I earned from other
brokers&mdash;running errands for them and doing writing
at home in the evenings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. It is very creditable to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Mr. Fenton said I was lazy,&rdquo; replied Matt
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care what he said. He is a very
mean man&mdash;I am finding that out more and more
every day. I myself intend to leave just as soon as
I can find another place. I have been there three
months, and can hardly bear it longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last stenographer only stayed two months,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
and the one before that, a man, didn&rsquo;t stay the week
out,&rdquo; grinned Matt. &ldquo;They soon find out what
kind of a man he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would leave to-morrow, only I cannot afford
to be out of work, and times are somewhat dull.
But, about your proposed venture. You will need
sixty dollars more to hold an equal share if you go
in, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ida Bartlett meditated for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I might let you have that money,&rdquo; she
said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have you got it?&rdquo; stammered
Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I and my two sisters have saved quite a
bit out of our earnings, you must know. I&rsquo;ll have
to ask Kate and Jennie and mother first. If they
are willing, I&rsquo;ll let you have the sixty dollars, and
then you and this Dilks can form an equal partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; exclaimed the boy warmly,
for the offer was entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than I ought to be, Matt. You saved
me from great annoyance this noon, and I have not
forgotten the many favors you have done me from
time to time. When did you say you were to meet
this Dilks?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This evening. I ought to be on my way to his
hotel now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do not let me detain you longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will speak to my two sisters and my mother
to-night, and I will let you know to-morrow what
they think of the matter. If they do not consent, I
can let you have twenty-five dollars on my own
account, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. But, supposing the venture doesn&rsquo;t
pay? We may go all to pieces on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk that&mdash;with you,&rdquo; smiled Ida Bartlett.
&ldquo;If you cannot make it pay in one place, I know
you&rsquo;ll soon find some other place where it will pay.
The main thing is to make sure that this Andrew
Dilks is honest. I would not like to hear of you
being swindled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor would I want to be swindled,&rdquo; smiled Matt.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t pay, and, besides, I might find it a
hard job to pay back what I had borrowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may make a fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be content if we made a good living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would be able to see a good part of the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best part of it&mdash;to me. I hate to
stay in one place all the while. Besides&rdquo;&mdash;Matt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;it will give me a chance to
look for my father, if he is still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor boy,&rdquo; returned Ida Bartlett sympathetically.
&ldquo;Always thinking of him! Well, I
trust, with all my heart, that you may some day
find your father, alive and well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later found Matt on his way to
the Columbus Hotel. The Bowery was crowded
with all classes of people, some just returning from
work, and others out sightseeing and buying, but
the boy had no difficulty in making his way along
at a rapid gait. In less than a quarter of an hour he
reached the hotel and entered the office. He was
about to accost the clerk at the desk, when somebody
tapped him on the shoulder, and turning he saw
Andrew Dilks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been watching for you,&rdquo; said the young
man. &ldquo;I was a little afraid you might disappoint
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was detained,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;But I am at your
service now. Where shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My room is rather small and warm, but it is
more private than the reading-room down here,&rdquo;
returned Andrew Dilks. &ldquo;Suppose we go up there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
You can sit by the window and get what little
breeze there is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started for the stairs (there was no elevator,
as in all better-class hotels), and were soon comfortably
seated in Andrew Dilks&rsquo; room, an apartment
on the third floor, in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a very elegant place,&rdquo; remarked the
young man apologetically, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s cheap, and that&rsquo;s
what I wanted. A fellow can&rsquo;t spend his money
and save it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, old Gulligan only gave me ten
dollars a week, and out of that I had to pay for
many articles that got broken. He put off what he
could on me, whether it was my fault or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you said you had a hundred and thirty-five
dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s not much, but it&rsquo;s something. I wish
you had as much. I&rsquo;ve figured it that we might
start with a single horse and an ordinary covered
wagon on two hundred and seventy dollars, and still
keep twenty dollars in cash for emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea I can raise the amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can? Good enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, first, I want you to give me some of the
particulars of your scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that willingly. I want you to understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
every detail before you invest. Then you will know
just what to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Dilks brought out a sheet of paper and a
pencil and began to do some figuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will put down our combined capital at two
hundred and fifty dollars,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, what
can we get a good horse for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred dollars!&rdquo; laughed Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, but we must get one cheaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing we look around for a bargain at one
hundred dollars, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nearer the figure. We do not want a
fancy animal nor a particularly fast one. A horse
that can pull our wagon ten to twenty miles a day
once or twice a week will answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; we can trade him off for something better
later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll put down a hundred for the horse.
The wagon ought not to cost over fifty or sixty
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it seventy-five for wagon and harness,&rdquo;
said Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will foot up to two hundred with rubber
blankets and extras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will. Well, even that will leave us
with fifty dollars for stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will that be enough?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it do. If we run out I can leave
you with the turnout, and come back to New York
and buy more, and have it shipped as freight to the
nearest railroad station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. I suppose they do not do any trusting
with auctioneers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with such traveling auctioneers as we will
be. I would rather buy for cash, anyway, for you
can buy much cheaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you can. What would you take along,
and where would you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea for the balance of this summer would
be to strike out through New York State down into
Pennsylvania, and then across to New Jersey.
Then we can rent a store in some small town for the
winter, especially for the holidays, and start out
early in the spring for the New England States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan met with Matt&rsquo;s approval, and he asked
what goods Andrew Dilks thought would be the
most profitable to take along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a list here in my pocket,&rdquo; returned the
young man, bringing it forth. &ldquo;You see, it includes
fancy articles and statuary, besides cheap watches,
table cutlery, spoons, imitation gold rings, such musical
instruments as accordions, banjos and violins,
albums, razors, whips, and a dozen others. That
ought to meet the wants in almost any small town.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you play the musical instruments?&rdquo; asked
Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can play the accordion&mdash;not very well, but
enough to show the instrument off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can play the banjo, and also the harmonica.
You had better lay in a stock of mouth harmonicas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will if you can play them. They
will sell readily if they are shown off. It is good
you can play the banjo. We can play that and the
accordion whenever we want to open up, and thus
attract a crowd. Some use a bell, but music, even
when it is poor, is better. Sometimes I used to
sing a comic song or two for old Gulligan when we
were on the road, but I didn&rsquo;t much care to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wouldn&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; said Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gulligan sold lots of what are called &lsquo;fake&rsquo;
goods,&rdquo; went on Andrew Dilks. &ldquo;But my intention
is to sell honest goods and sell them for just
what they are. We will perhaps not make as much,
but people will be better pleased, and they will not
want to run us out of town if we ever go back to
the same place again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am with you there,&rdquo; said Matt heartily. &ldquo;I
was afraid you might want to palm off a lot of trash
for first-class goods and I didn&rsquo;t want to be a party
to any such transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued to talk the subject over for fully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
an hour, and by that time both understood each
other thoroughly, and had decided, if Matt could
raise the necessary cash, to go into the scheme
without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we ought to do all the traveling
possible before cold weather sets in,&rdquo; said Andrew
Dilks. &ldquo;It is in the villages where the most money
is to be made, especially now, when the farmers are
about done harvesting and have some ready cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I am out of work, I can start the moment I
get the money,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;And even if I don&rsquo;t
get that other money, I am willing to put in every
cent of what I have now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following morning Matt was surprised to
receive another visit from Ida Bartlett, who had
eaten an unusually early breakfast so that she might
come over before going to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you would be anxious to hear from me,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;It is all right. The others are willing
to let you have the money for a year at the regular
bank interest, three per cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, and I&rsquo;ll try to pay it back before
the year is out,&rdquo; returned Matt, much relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have arranged to go into the scheme?
It is all satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I wish you every success.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED SET-BACK.</h3>
</div>
<p>The next three days were busy ones for Matt and
his newly-made partner. After they had drawn up
and signed such papers as they deemed proper between
themselves, they set out to look for a horse
and wagon.</p>
<p>Andrew Dilks had cut several advertisements of
bargains from the morning papers, and these they
hunted up one after another.</p>
<p>The so-styled bargains proved to be more or less
false. In nearly every instance they ran across
some shrewd horse-dealer, who, under pretense of
selling an outfit for a widow, or man who had left
the city, tried to palm off on them an animal and
wagon not worth taking away.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, however, when they were
almost ready to give up and go to a regular dealer,
they ran across a German baker who was selling
out at a private sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vos go to Chermany next veek,&rdquo; he explained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
to the two. &ldquo;Mine old fadder vos dead, and he vos
left me all his land and houses in Bremen. See, I
vos shown you der letter from der lawyers vot have
his vill got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he produced a large letter-head, upon which
was written a dozen lines in German, which neither
could read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;Show us
your horse and wagon, and set a bottom cash price
on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come dis vay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baker led the way around the corner to a
boarding-stable, and brought forth a good, chunky
brown-and-white horse, that did not look to be over
six years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand around, Billy!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Dere he vos,
chentlemen, and chust so goot a horse as der vos in
New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything the matter with him?&rdquo; asked Matt,
as he began an examination of the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a ding, sir. He vos sound as a tollar, and
chentle as a lamb. I vos use him on der bread
route for a year and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is the wagon?&rdquo; questioned Andrew
Dilks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here vos der wagon,&rdquo; said the baker, as he ran
the vehicle out so that they might look it over.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>It was a four-wheeled affair, quite large and
heavy. There was one seat in the center, and before
and behind this were two big boxes, each with
a hinged lid. In the rear was a rack for pies and
cakes. There was also a box under the seat, and a
money drawer which opened with a concealed push
button.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just the thing for us,&rdquo; whispered Andrew
to Matt. &ldquo;For a one-horse wagon, it could not be
better arranged. The running gear seems to be in
good condition, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, vot you dinks of them?&rdquo; asked the baker,
after they had finished their survey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the harness?&rdquo; asked Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she vos, new two veeks ago, and here vos
der vip, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the lowest you can take for the
rig?&rdquo; asked Andrew. &ldquo;We are willing to pay spot
cash, but cannot afford a fancy figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vos sold der whole dings for dree hundred
dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this announcement Matt&rsquo;s face fell. Three
hundred dollars! It was more than they had to
spend for both turnout and stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred dollars,&rdquo; repeated Andrew
Dilks. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, we can&rsquo;t do business
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dot&rsquo;s too pad. How much you gif, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will give you a hundred and seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this announcement the German baker held up
his hands in horror, and muttered a number of
ejaculations in his native tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it two hundred and seventy-five,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den take der turnout for two hundred and
fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Matt, and with a wink
to Andrew Dilks, he pulled his companion toward
the stable doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; shouted the baker, in alarm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
go yet, chentlemen. Make dot figure two hundred
and twenty-five, and it vos more as tog cheap at
dot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is, but we can&rsquo;t afford to pay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could haf der dime to sell, I vos got more
as dot, chentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t
got to accept our offer, you know. We&rsquo;ll look
around for something cheaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You vill bay cash on der spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but you must give us a free and clear bill
of sale.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I vos do dot. Make it chust two hundred
dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Andrew Dilks had set his mind on getting a
further reduction, and at last the bargain was
settled, and they paid over a hundred and ninety
dollars for the turnout, leaving them still ten
dollars to expend upon rubber blankets and other
necessary articles.</p>
<p>The purchase completed, they made arrangements
with the boarding-stable keeper to keep the horse
and wagon for them until the following Monday
morning. In the meantime they procured some
paint, and painted over the baker&rsquo;s signs on the
wagon, and then Andrew, who was a fair letterer,
painted on each side of the wagon-cover the following:</p>
<p class='sign center'>THE EUREKA AUCTION COMPANY.<br />
Best and Cheapest Goods on Earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that ought to attract attention wherever
we go,&rdquo; said Andrew when the job was finished.
&ldquo;The word company makes it sound big,
and we can call ourselves a company as well as
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday and Saturday the two made a tour of
the wholesale houses in New York, and Andrew
expended the fifty dollars as judiciously as possible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
in the purchase of goods. As business was rather
slow, and ready money scarce, he struck several
decided bargains, especially in cutlery and musical
instruments. He had all of the goods sent up to the
stable, and the two worked until ten o&rsquo;clock Saturday
night stowing away all of the stock in their
wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we are all ready for the start on Monday
morning,&rdquo; said Andrew as the two walked away
from the stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we haven&rsquo;t decided where we shall go
first yet,&rdquo; returned Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us leave that until the last minute. We
know about where we are going, and it doesn&rsquo;t
make much difference what villages we strike so
long as we do the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunday passed quickly enough for Matt. He attended
church and the Sunday-school into which Ida
Bartlett had introduced him, and in the evening he
packed his valise with all of his worldly possessions.
Ida Bartlett also came over to bid him good-by, and
remained to give him such advice as he might have
received from an elder sister.</p>
<p>Matt had arranged to meet Andrew at the stable
at six o&rsquo;clock sharp, and quarter of an hour before
the appointed time found him on his way to the
place, valise in hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show Andrew that I mean to be on time,&rdquo;
he thought to himself, as he turned into the street
upon which the stable was situated.</p>
<p>Suddenly he saw a crowd running up from the
block below. There were at least a dozen men and
boys, some of whom were shouting at the top of
their lungs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; repeated Matt quickly. &ldquo;I wonder
where it can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But hardly had he uttered the words than, happening
to glance toward the stable in which their
turnout was located, he saw a thick volume of
smoke come pouring out of several of the upper
windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; he gasped, his face blanching.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that stable, and our horse and wagon with the
stock still inside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place is doomed!&rdquo; said a man beside Matt.
&ldquo;See how the fire is gaining headway! They
won&rsquo;t be able to save a single horse or anything
else!&rdquo;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_IX_THE_RESULT_OF_A_FIRE' id='CHAPTER_IX_THE_RESULT_OF_A_FIRE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>THE RESULT OF A FIRE.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was no wonder that Matt&rsquo;s heart was filled
with dismay when he saw the stable which contained
the auction outfit being thus rapidly devoured
by the flames. Almost every cent he possessed was
invested in the horse, wagon and stock, and if they
were consumed he would be left in New York City
next to penniless.</p>
<p>Close to where he was standing was a grocery
store, and rushing into this he threw his valise on
the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep this for me, please!&rdquo; he cried to the proprietor.
&ldquo;I want to try to save my horse and
wagon!&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_4' id='linki_4'></a>

<p class='caption'>
SAVING THE WAGON. <span class='illustrator'>Y. A.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>And before the grocer could reply he was out of
the store again, and running toward the burning
stable as fast as his feet could carry him.</p>
<p>When he reached the front of the building, which
was three stories high, and quite broad and deep,
he found an excited mob of stable-hands, cab-drivers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and tradespeople assembled, each trying to get inside
to save his belongings.</p>
<p>The owner of the stable was also present, having
just arrived, and was directing, or trying to direct,
the movements of the highly excited ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into the alley on the left!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;You can get more out of the side doors. The
smoke is blowing too thickly out here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rush was made for the alley and Matt got
into the midst of the crowd. The side doors, to
which the owner of the stable had referred, were
found to be securely bolted from the inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get some axes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a log and smash in the doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that!&rdquo; yelled Matt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb
through one of the windows and open the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for the boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a boost up, somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a dozen willing hands raised Matt&rsquo;s form to
one of the small side windows, and an instant later
the boy&rsquo;s form disappeared within the smoke-laden
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t stand it in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be smothered to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once inside, Matt found it advisable to crouch
low down to the floor, for the smoke did, indeed,
almost smother him. He could see but little, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
had to feel his way out of a stall, and across the
floor to where the doors he wished to open were
located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid our nag will be a goner!&rdquo; he
thought dismally. &ldquo;A horse never can stand anything
in the shape of a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the doors were reached. Fortunately, he
found the bolts at once, and lost not a second in
drawing them from their sockets. Then he gave
the doors a kick outward, and willing hands flung
them far back against the side of the building.
Then came a rush of men and boys, all eager to
save something. For the moment it looked as if
Matt would be carried from his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, don&rsquo;t knock me down!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Remember,
I opened the doors for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he did!&rdquo; returned a burly cab driver. &ldquo;Give
the lad a show!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Matt was given room. He quickly
found his way through the smoke and heat to
where the wagon stood, ready for the start on the
road. The horse was but a few feet away snorting
in alarm.</p>
<p>Matt had handled horses before, and he now knew
just the best possible thing to do. Taking off his
coat, he flung it over Billy&rsquo;s head, thus completely
blindfolding him. Then he led the animal out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
of the stall, and started him toward the open
doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Matt, is that you?&rdquo; yelled a voice close at
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Andy, and I&rsquo;m glad you have come. See
if you can pull the wagon out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you manage Billy alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Matt had his hands full, as he soon learned.
Billy was not in the humor to listen and walk the
way he desired. He pranced about wildly, and the
boy had all he could do to keep from having his
feet stepped upon.</p>
<p>But at last Matt managed to reach the open
doors, and then he gave the horse a sharp cut on
the flank, which sent him up the alley on a canter.
The boy did not wait to ascertain how far Billy
might continue on his way, but turned swiftly to
help his partner, who was straining every nerve to
budge the wagon from its resting-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The floor is up-hill to the side doors!&rdquo; gasped
Andrew Dilks. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get it out, I&rsquo;m afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get it out!&rdquo; returned Matt desperately.
&ldquo;Let me get hold of the shafts and you
push. And be quick, for the floor overhead looks
as if it was going to give away at any minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy did as Matt directed, and together they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
strained to their utmost. At first the wagon,
heavily loaded, refused to budge, but then it moved
slowly from its place against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! we are getting it!&rdquo; cried Andrew
Dilks. &ldquo;Be sure and guide it right, Matt. Can
you see, or is the smoke too thick for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see; but&mdash;hold on, or we&rsquo;ll smash into
that other wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt held back, and allowed another wagon to
pass out first. In the meantime, the burning brands
from overhead were coming down livelier than ever.
One caught Matt on the left arm, burning the flesh
slightly, and another landed on Andrew Dilks&rsquo; neck,
causing the auctioneer to howl with sudden pain.</p>
<p>Outside could be heard the whistle of fire-engines
and the clanging of hook-and-ladder truck bells.
Then came a heavy stream of water from somewhere
behind them, nearly lifting Andy from his feet.</p>
<p>But the way was now once more clear, and Matt
yelled to his partner to push. Both exerted every
nerve, and ten seconds later the wagon rolled out of
the open doors, and was guided by Matt up the
alley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness we are out!&rdquo; panted the boy,
as they brought the wagon to a standstill in the
midst of half a dozen carriages. &ldquo;Another minute
in there would just about have settled me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was getting dangerous,&rdquo; returned Andy,
with a serious shake of his head, as he tied his handkerchief
over his burned neck. &ldquo;Hark! what is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were called forth by a dull boom,
which made the soft dirt in the alley quake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The upper flooring has come down!&rdquo; shouted
several in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be able to get any more stuff out
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were just in time,&rdquo; remarked Matt, with a
shiver. &ldquo;Supposing we had been in there when
that flooring, with all the burning hay and those
sleighs that were stored there, came down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be very thankful, not only for that,
but for being able to save our wagon and our horse.
If they had been burned up we would have been
next door to beggars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, where is Billy?&rdquo; cried Matt. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see him anywhere around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here with the wagon and I&rsquo;ll hunt him up,&rdquo;
replied Matt; and he started off without further
delay.</p>
<p>The alleyway had now become so choked up with
vehicles, horses, and people that it was with great
difficulty that he fought his way through the dense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
mass out to the next street. Once here, he looked
up and down for the horse, but could see nothing of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of a brown and white
horse around here?&rdquo; he asked of a stable-hand
standing near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; just saw him gallop up the street,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;You had better jump on a horse-car if
you want to catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him run clean out of sight, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he must be halfway up to Harlem by this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt waited to hear no more, but boarded the
first horse-car which came along bound north. He
took a position on the front platform, and as they
moved along kept his eyes open for a sight of the
animal in which he owned a half-interest.</p>
<p>Ten blocks had been passed, and the boy was
beginning to grow anxious, when, chancing to look
over the fence of a small yard adjoining a blacksmith
shop, he saw a horse standing tied to a post.
A second look convinced him that it was Billy, and
he at once leaped from the moving car and hurried
toward the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what can I do for you?&rdquo; asked the
blacksmith, a tall, heavy-set fellow, as he left his
bellows, where he had been blowing up the fire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my horse, please,&rdquo; returned Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your horse? Which horse is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The runaway you just caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any runaway,&rdquo; returned the blacksmith
boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the boy in amazement. &ldquo;Why, of
course you have. He is tied to the post in the
yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No runaway here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the brown and white horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That horse was just left here to be shod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment Matt was too dumfounded to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be shod?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Who left him
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A colored man. I don&rsquo;t know his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is my horse, and he doesn&rsquo;t need
shoeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; returned
the blacksmith darkly. &ldquo;He was left here and
that&rsquo;s all I know about it. You&rsquo;ll have to hunt up
the colored man, and fix it up with him if you want
the horse.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>ON THE ROAD AT LAST.</h3>
</div>
<p>Had the blacksmith spoken with more real concern,
Matt would have believed what he said, but
there was that in the fellow&rsquo;s manner which tended
to make the boy suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago was it that the colored man left
the horse?&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that, as near as I can remember. I&rsquo;ve
been rather busy this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That horse did not get away until about fifteen
minutes ago,&rdquo; returned Matt coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must be mistaken,&rdquo; returned the blacksmith
smoothly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not mistaken,&rdquo; replied Matt, and his
tones began to grow sharper. &ldquo;He just got away
from me, after I rescued him from a burning
stable. He is my horse, and I intend to take him
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>As Matt spoke he crossed the blacksmith shop to
where a doorway led to the little yard beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up there!&rdquo; cried the blacksmith roughly.
&ldquo;You are not going out there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, and you can&rsquo;t stop me,&rdquo; returned
Matt spiritedly. &ldquo;I own that horse, or at least I
own a half-interest in him, and if you dare to molest
me you&rsquo;ll get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I?&rdquo; sneered the blacksmith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will. If you stop me, I&rsquo;ll call in the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words the blacksmith&rsquo;s face fell. Evidently
he had not anticipated that a mere boy would
take such a decided stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that colored man&mdash;&rdquo; he began, more
mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was a colored man in the case, you can
explain matters to suit yourself. As for me, I
believe you caught the horse yourself and wanted
to do what you could to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; cried the blacksmith, with a
threatening gesture. &ldquo;Do you take me for a
thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what I take you for. That is my
horse, and I am going to take him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And undaunted by the blacksmith&rsquo;s manner,
Matt marched out into the yard, and untied Billy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
who was covered with sweat, and still trembling
from fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s playing a bold game you are,&rdquo; grumbled
the man of the anvil, as the boy led the horse
through the blacksmith-shop toward the front door.
&ldquo;I reckon you think you are mighty smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has to be smart to deal with such a man as
you!&rdquo; retorted Matt. &ldquo;Had you done the fair
thing at the start, I might have rewarded you
for stopping the horse, but as it is, I don&rsquo;t believe
you deserve a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this parting shot, which, by the way
was fully deserved by the dishonest blacksmith,
Matt sprang upon Billy&rsquo;s back and rode off.</p>
<p>When the boy reached the alleyway again he
found that the fire department had gotten the fire
under control, and that much of the crowd of people
had gone on about their business. In the space
around the wagon several <a name='TC_1'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'cabman'">cabmen</ins> were busy getting
out their horses and cabs, all thankful that
their turnouts and animals had not been consumed
by the conflagration, which had all but leveled the
great stable to the ground.</p>
<p>Andy was seated on the wagon, anxiously awaiting
his return. While the two harnessed Billy into
place, Matt told his partner of the trouble he had
experienced.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That blacksmith meant to bluff you off and
keep the horse,&rdquo; said the auctioneer. &ldquo;If you
hadn&rsquo;t come back soon I would have gone off after
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the wagon damaged?&rdquo; questioned Matt
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the slightest. I have examined everything
carefully. And the stock is O. K. too. We
can start off just as if nothing had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t decided yet as to just where we
are to go,&rdquo; returned the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;I meant
to tell you before, but the fire drove it clean out of
my head. I saw a fellow yesterday who is going
to strike out up through Harlem to-morrow. He
was going to take the very route I had thought
out. So I was going to propose that we take the
ferry over to Jersey City, and strike out through
New Jersey first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one way will suit me just as well as another,&rdquo;
returned Matt. &ldquo;So New Jersey it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than five minutes later they were ready
to start. The owner of the stable, nearly distracted
over his loss, was around, and into his hand they
thrust the money they owed him. Then Matt procured
his valise, and without waiting to be questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
by the police and the firemen any more than
was necessary, they drove off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very favorable start,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment,
as the scene of the conflagration was left
behind. &ldquo;But they say &lsquo;a bad beginning makes a
good ending,&rsquo; so we ought not to lose heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose heart!&rdquo; cried Matt lightly. &ldquo;No, indeed!
I am thankful we are able to start, even though we
do look like a couple of tramps,&rdquo; he added with a
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a wash-up when we are across the
ferry. We&rsquo;ll have lots of time, for we won&rsquo;t be
able to do any business to-day. We must get at
least twenty or thirty miles from New York before
we attempt to open up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The drive down to Cortlandt street ferry was an
uneventful one through the crowded streets. A
boat had just come in when they reached the ferry-house,
and after paying the fare, they drove upon
this, and were soon on their way to the New Jersey
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the road?&rdquo; asked Matt, as they
tied up upon an open street on the other side, and
went into the great ferry-house to wash and brush
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the roads through Newark and Elizabeth,&rdquo;
returned Andrew Dilks. &ldquo;I think we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
better strike along the New Jersey Central Railroad
as far as Bound Brook or Somerville, and then
strike through Flemington, and across to the Delaware
River, and so on into Pennsylvania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; returned Matt.</p>
<p>It was exactly half-past ten o&rsquo;clock when they
left the vicinity of the ferry in Jersey City, and
moved off toward the old plank road, so called,
which leads to Newark, five miles distant. Both
were in excellent spirits, despite the thrilling experience
through which they had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have here a list of all the articles we have in
stock,&rdquo; said Andy, as he set Billy on a brisk trot.
&ldquo;You had better study it. The prices are also put
down, and of course, we never will auction a thing
off for less, unless it is unsalable otherwise and we
wish to dispose of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But supposing a thing is put up and people
won&rsquo;t bid above a certain figure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will buy it in ourselves, or get some one to
bid for us, or else refuse to take a bid under a certain
sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt took the sheet of paper, and resting on the
box in the back of the wagon, began to study it
carefully, and so absorbed did he become that he
did not notice when Newark was reached, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
only aroused when Andy drew up in front of a
restaurant and asked him if he did not feel like
having some dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can just bet I do!&rdquo; exclaimed Matt. &ldquo;The
fire and the drive have made me as hungry as a
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The restaurant was not a very large place, and
but few customers were present. They ordered
what they wished, and it was soon brought to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go to one of those high-toned
places where they charge big prices,&rdquo; observed
Andy, as he began to fall to. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to
cut a spread until we see how our venture is going
to pan out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right there,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;As it
is, I think our supply of cash is getting mighty low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice the knives and forks are rather rusty
here,&rdquo; went on Andy. &ldquo;I wonder if I can&rsquo;t sell the
proprietor some table cutlery. We have some on
board that is both cheap and good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d try it by all means,&rdquo; cried Matt heartily.</p>
<p>So when the meal was concluded Andrew Dilks
walked up to the proprietor, who was also cashier,
and paid their bill. Then he asked the man if he
did not think some new knives and forks would be
appreciated by his customers.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt but what they would be,&rdquo; returned
the restaurant keeper. &ldquo;But they cost too
much money, and times are rather hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can sell you some cheap,&rdquo; returned Andy, and
he mentioned his price.</p>
<p>The restaurant man smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too cheap to be good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must have
some that will stand the wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me show you them. Matt, go out and
bring in a few dozen of the No. 23 knives and forks,
and also some of the X23 spoons,&rdquo; went on Andy
briskly.</p>
<p>Matt at once complied, and his partner continued
to talk to the restaurant keeper, thus keeping his
attention. When the articles were brought Andy
invited the prospective purchaser to make a thorough
examination of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send a couple down to the kitchen and have
them scoured. They are triple-plated, and will
stand it,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Andy&rsquo;s business-like way pleased the restaurant
keeper, and after a little more talk he purchased
three dozen each of knives and forks and two dozen
spoons.</p>
<p>The price was paid over, and both Andy and Matt
were congratulating themselves on their good luck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
when a man who had been standing near the window
of the restaurant peering in stepped inside and
tapped both on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to see your license for selling,&rdquo; he
said sternly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>HARSH TREATMENT.</h3>
</div>
<p>Both Matt and Andy were considerably taken
aback by the unexpected demand of the stranger.
When they had come to Newark they had not expected
to sell anything, and therefore had not given
the question of a license a single thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, but I am sorry to state we have no
license,&rdquo; returned Andy frankly. &ldquo;We did not expect
to make any sales here, but were going straight
through to Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; sneered the man, who was a special
officer attached to the police department. &ldquo;But I
saw you make the sale, and you must come with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Andy, let us pay the license,&rdquo; exclaimed
Matt, in a low voice, as visions of a week or a month
in jail floated before his mind. It would be simply
terrible to be locked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we will have to do,&rdquo; returned Andy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
who had been through such a predicament before,
and was not, therefore, greatly alarmed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
be afraid; we will come out all right. Only it will
cost us two or three dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it costs fifty&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to run
afoul of the law,&rdquo; returned Matt bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; returned his partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo; demanded the officer
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go with you and pay the license,&rdquo;
replied Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ride with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care if I do,&rdquo; said the officer, and all three
hopped on the wagon seat, and Matt drove off.</p>
<p>The office where licenses could be procured was
at the City Hall, on Broad Street. When they turned
into that thoroughfare Matt uttered a cry of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a broad street!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he surveyed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the broadest in any eastern city,&rdquo;
returned the officer, who seemed inclined to be more
friendly now that they had shown a disposition to
do the right thing.</p>
<p>Inside of the City Hall they were compelled to
wait near half an hour before they could procure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
their license. Then they were asked for how long
a term they desired it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For to-day only,&rdquo; returned Andy, and so it was
made out and as quickly paid for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m glad we are out of that scrape so
easily!&rdquo; murmured Matt, as the two walked back
to their wagon. &ldquo;I was afraid they would lock us
up for ten days or a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would have their hands full locking up
all the peddlers who try to sell goods without a
license,&rdquo; laughed Andy. &ldquo;All they care for is the
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to pay in almost every town we
go, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, every town. Some places charge so much
that we won&rsquo;t try to sell in them. I&rsquo;ll make it a
point after this to find out about a license as soon
as we enter a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do that by all means,&rdquo; returned Matt,
much relieved.</p>
<p>Now that they had a license good for the balance
of the day, Matt moved that they remain in Newark
and try to make more sales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us try all the restaurants,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
may be able to sell more of those knives and forks
and spoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t exactly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
auctioneering, but it pays just as well, so we have
no cause to grumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned back into the business portion of the
city and drove along slowly until two restaurants,
directly opposite to each other, were reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take one and you can take the other,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;Be sure and sell all you can,&rdquo; he added,
with a laugh.</p>
<p>Matt nodded, and with half a dozen samples
under his arm, he entered the restaurant on the
right.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that the boy&rsquo;s heart beat
rather fast. This was the first time he had endeavored
to effect a sale solely on his own responsibility.
Moreover, Andy was pitted against him, trying to
sell goods in a similar way to similar people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do as well as he,&rdquo; thought Matt. &ldquo;If I
don&rsquo;t he may imagine I am not worthy of being an
equal partner in the concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place Matt had entered was handsomely
fitted up in the latest style. It was quite large, but
at this hour of the day was but scantily patronized.
In the back half a dozen waiters were discussing
the merits of certain race horses, while behind the
cashier&rsquo;s desk a young man, with an enormous
diamond, was reading a copy of a sensational weekly.</p>
<p>A waiter rushed forward to conduct Matt to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
seat at one of the tables, but the boy shook his head
and turned to the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I see the proprietor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The clerk had laid down his paper and gave Matt
an ugly stare before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are another one of them,&rdquo; he said
slowly, as he surveyed the boy from head to foot.</p>
<p>Matt was somewhat mystified by this, but smiled
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I am&mdash;if you say so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did
you say the proprietor was in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t say so. Say, you&rsquo;ll wish you hadn&rsquo;t
come here if old Mattison gives you a chance,&rdquo; went
on the young man, in a lower voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why will I wish that?&rdquo; questioned Matt, more
mystified than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s a tough customer to get along
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if my goods and the price suit, why, it
ought to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goods and price? What are you talking about?&rdquo;
demanded the young man quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goods I have to sell&mdash;knives, forks, and
spoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! I thought you were another of
those chumps that want my place here. Old
Mattison gave me notice to quit next Saturday, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
put an advertisement in the paper for a new clerk,
and there have been about a dozen here already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And none of them suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit! He&rsquo;s a man that is never suited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps I won&rsquo;t be able to sell him any
goods,&rdquo; returned Matt, his heart sinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t likely. Business is poor, and he ain&rsquo;t
buying more than he can help. You can try him,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man behind the desk rang the bell for
one of the waiters, and sent that individual upstairs
for the proprietor. The waiter was gone nearly five
minutes before he returned, accompanied by a short,
stout man, with bushy black hair and a heavy
beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, what can I do for you?&rdquo; asked the
man of Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are not too busy I would like to show
you some goods which are both good and very
cheap,&rdquo; returned Matt, as easily as he could, and
without waiting for a reply he unrolled his package
of samples, and placed them upon the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that what you called me downstairs for?&rdquo;
cried the proprietor of the restaurant, in a rage.
&ldquo;Make me throw down a good hand at cards just to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
look at a lot of tin knives and forks! You peddlers
are getting more bold every day. The police ought
to sit down on every one of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry if I disturbed your leisure,&rdquo; returned
Matt, as mildly as he could. &ldquo;But, I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you would just like to cheat me
into buying a lot of your trash,&rdquo; finished the
restaurant proprietor. &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t do anything
of the kind, and you can take that for your
impudence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And hastily gathering up the package of samples,
the restaurant keeper walked to the open doorway
and flung knives, forks and spoons into the muddy
gutter!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>MATT STANDS UP FOR HIMSELF.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was evident, by the self-satisfied look upon the
restaurant-keeper&rsquo;s face, that the hot-tempered man
supposed that he had done a very smart thing in
thus disposing of Matt&rsquo;s wares by throwing the
bundle into the muddy gutter of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now pick up your goods and skip out!&rdquo; he cried,
as he turned to the boy. &ldquo;And the next time you
be careful how you disturb folks when they are
trying to take it a little easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the instant Matt was stupefied, and stood
still, hardly moving a muscle.</p>
<p>Then the boy&rsquo;s natural temper arose to the surface,
and for the moment he felt as if he must fly
at the man and pound him in the face just as hard
as he could. His face grew first red and then
deadly pale. The man saw the change in his
countenance, saw the fire flash in the boy&rsquo;s eyes,
and stopped short just as he was about to repeat
his injunction to leave the establishment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a&mdash;a brute!&rdquo; exclaimed Matt, stepping
forward with clinched fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the restaurant-keeper, so
loudly that several customers and a number of the
waiters gathered round to learn the cause of the
trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you are a brute!&rdquo; repeated Matt, undaunted
by the fierce look the restaurant-keeper had assumed.
&ldquo;If you did not wish to buy from me you
could have said so. There was no need for you to
throw my goods in the gutter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up and clear out!&rdquo; growled the man. &ldquo;I
want no back talk from the likes of you. Do you
suppose I buy from beggars and thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am neither a beggar nor a thief!&rdquo; returned
Matt striding still closer. &ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t allow you
nor any one else to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t?&rdquo; sneered the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Matt firmly. &ldquo;My
business is just as honest and honorable as yours,
even though I may not make such enormous profits,&rdquo;
he added, bound in some way to &ldquo;get
square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, are you going to get out, or must I pitch
you out?&rdquo; howled the man more savagely than
ever.</p>
<p>For the moment Matt did not reply. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
very angry, but knew it would do him more harm
than good to lose his temper. Yet he was not the
person to allow the insults he had received to pass
unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will get out just as soon as you restore my
goods to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had no right whatever
to throw them into the gutter and soil
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let me say, too, that I expect my goods to
come back to me just as clean as they were when
you took them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say another word and I&rsquo;ll stand you on
your head!&rdquo; fumed the proprietor of the restaurant,
but the look in Matt&rsquo;s eyes kept him from laying
hands upon the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dare to touch me I&rsquo;ll call in the police,&rdquo;
replied Matt, more sharply than ever. &ldquo;I have a
license, and by that license the police are bound to
protect me. Now, you get my goods back for me
and I&rsquo;ll leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in Jericho first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; but remember, if anything is lost or
damaged, you&rsquo;ll pay the bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for the boy!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the men
who had just been lunching in the place. &ldquo;I like
to see a fellow stick up for his rights.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;See here, I want no outside interference here!&rdquo;
blustered the restaurant-keeper. &ldquo;I am fully capable
of attending to this affair myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to see that the boy gets a
show,&rdquo; returned the other coolly, as he paid the
amount of his check and lit a cigar taken from his
pocket. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was a fair deal to throw
his stuff in the gutter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; put in another customer. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
to make a living, just the same as all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; cried the restaurant-keeper, waving
them away with his hand. &ldquo;Come, now, no
more talk!&rdquo; he went on to Matt. &ldquo;Go, before I
have you thrown out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t budge a step, excepting it is to call the
police,&rdquo; returned Matt, more firmly than ever, now
that he saw he had friends in the crowd. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give you just five minutes to give me back my
goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The restaurant-keeper began to bluster and
threaten, and even sent a waiter out, ostensibly to
call in a policeman. But Matt was not frightened,
and in the end another waiter was sent to gather up
the sample goods, wipe them off and restore them to
the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, boy!&rdquo; said one of the customers,
as he followed Matt out upon the sidewalk. &ldquo;Always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
stick up for your rights,&rdquo; and he nodded pleasantly
and passed on.</p>
<p>When Matt reached the wagon he found Andy
had not yet come back. He accordingly looked
around, and seeing another restaurant about half a
block further down the street entered it.</p>
<p>He found the proprietor behind the desk, laughing
quietly to himself. He had heard of what had happened
in his neighbor&rsquo;s place, and was immensely
tickled thereby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! ain&rsquo;t you the boy that had the row with
Mattison?&rdquo; he exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had some trouble with that man,&rdquo; said Matt.
&ldquo;But it was not my fault, I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came out ahead, didn&rsquo;t you? Ha! ha! ha!
It does me good to hear it. Tell me how the row
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt did so, and was compelled to go into all the
details, to which the man listened with keen interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Served him right! He can get along with nobody.
But you are a clever one, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Matt.</p>
<p>And then he began to talk business, showing up
his somewhat bedimmed samples to the best possible
advantage, and quoting prices in a manner that
made the restaurant-keeper think he was an old
hand at the business.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>The man was not particularly in need of anything,
but he liked Matt&rsquo;s way, and thought it was
worth something to have a good story to tell to his
rival&rsquo;s discredit. He bought four dozen triple-plated
spoons and a carving-knife, and then Matt
persuaded him to invest in a new toothpick holder,
and a match holder of aluminum, which were both
very pretty and cheap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just an even seven dollars!&rdquo; thought Matt, as
he hurried back to the wagon. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that
so bad. Our profits on that sale ought to be at
least two dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy was waiting for him. He had sold, after a
good deal of hard talking, a dozen knives and forks,
upon which he had been forced to make a slight
discount. He listened to Matt&rsquo;s story in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven dollars&rsquo; worth! That&rsquo;s fine, Matt! You
must be a born salesman. Keep right on, by all
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t expect any such luck every time,&rdquo;
returned the boy, and then he told the story of his
troubles in the first restaurant he had visited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was plucky in you to stick out as you did,&rdquo;
was Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I could
have done it. I would have gone out and picked up
the things myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t, never!&rdquo; cried Matt, and his whole
face showed the spirit within him.</p>
<p>It was only four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and
Andy suggested that they continue to try their
luck until sundown. So they drove on down the
street slowly, visiting every restaurant and many
stores on the way.</p>
<p>In one place Matt sold a dozen spoons, and in
another a fancy water-pitcher. Andy sold some
spoons also, and a cheap watch and chain, which
the buyer explained he intended to sell to some
customer for double the money.</p>
<p>At the last place at which they stopped Andy
made arrangements to remain all night. A stable
was also found for Billy and the wagon, and by
eight o&rsquo;clock the partners found themselves free
from business cares. Matt moved that they have
supper, and to this Andy willingly agreed.</p>
<p>While the two were waiting for their orders to
be filled, Andy brought out a bit of paper and a
pencil and began to figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The net receipts for the day were eighteen
dollars and a half,&rdquo; he said, when he had finished.
&ldquo;The goods and the license cost thirteen dollars
and sixty cents. That leaves a profit of four dollars
and ninety cents, which is not so bad, considering
that we only worked about five hours all told.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And what were our expenses?&rdquo; asked Matt.</p>
<p>Andy did a little more figuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expenses from this morning until to-morrow
morning, including this supper, about two dollars
and thirty cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have two dollars and sixty cents over
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is, without counting wear and tear on
wagon, harness, and so forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But that isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is not,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;If we do
as well as that every day we shall get along very
well, although I trust to do even better.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE CORN SALVE DOCTOR.</h3>
</div>
<p>After supper the two partners found that time
hung a little heavily upon their hands. Matt suggested
that they walk around the city a bit, taking
in the sights, but Andy was too tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do, though,&rdquo; said the
older member of the firm. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get one of the accordions
out and you can get a banjo, and we can
practice a little. There is nothing like being prepared
for an emergency, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, and we&rsquo;ll have to brush up quite a
bit if we wish to play in public,&rdquo; laughed Matt.</p>
<p>He accompanied Andy to the barn where the
wagon was stored, and they brought not only the
accordion and the banjo, but also a violin and a
mouth harmonica.</p>
<p>These instruments they took to the bedroom
which had been assigned to them, and here, while
it was yet early, they tuned up and began to practice
upon such simple tunes as both knew by heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
Matt first tried the banjo, and after he had it in
tune with the accordion, the partners played half a
dozen selections quite creditably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t do for grand opera soloists, but I
guess it will be good enough to attract crowds in
small country towns,&rdquo; laughed Andy, as he ground
out a lively German waltz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing we try the violin and banjo,&rdquo; suggested
Matt, and Andy took up the king of instruments.</p>
<p>But this did not go so well, and it was not long
before Andy turned back to the accordion, which,
according to his statement, half-played itself. Matt
tried the mouth harmonica, and surprised not only
Andy, but half a dozen listeners, by the wonderful
effects he produced upon the little instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; shouted Andy, as Matt finished
a particularly clever selection. &ldquo;If the auction
business fails, you can go on the variety stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;I understand
enough about it to know that it is little better than
a dog&rsquo;s life. I just as lief stick to what I&rsquo;m doing,
or become a traveling order salesman for some big
New York house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know but what that shows your
level-headedness,&rdquo; returned Andy.</p>
<p>The two slept soundly that night. Matt was up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
at five o&rsquo;clock the next morning, and he at once
aroused his partner. They had an early breakfast,
and then walked around to the stable where the
wagon was housed.</p>
<p>While they were hitching up Billy a middle-aged
man, rather slouchy in appearance, came shuffling
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the two young fellers what&rsquo;s running
this here auction wagon?&rdquo; he began, addressing
Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; returned the boy. &ldquo;What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good business, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; went on the
stranger, without answering the question which had
been put.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon there&rsquo;s a heap of money in it,&rdquo; proceeded
the shabby stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are not yet millionaires,&rdquo; put in Andy,
with a pleasant laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a feller what made a pile of money in
the auction business,&rdquo; remarked the man as he
ejected a quantity of tobacco juice from his mouth.
&ldquo;He was a rip-snorter at it, though&mdash;could talk a
table into walking off&mdash;and keep it up all day and
half the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this statement Matt and Andy made no reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Neither liked the looks of the newcomer, and both
wished he would go away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you don&rsquo;t want to take a fellow in, do
you?&rdquo; asked the man, after a slight pause, as he
came close beside Matt, who was nearest to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t any work for an outsider,&rdquo;
returned the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rustler when I get a-going, let me tell
you. I can tell stories and sing and sell more goods
than any one has any idea of. Besides that, I&rsquo;ve
got a new corn salve I put up myself which goes
like hot cakes. Barberry&rsquo;s Lightning Salve, I call
it&mdash;my name is Paul Barberry, you know&mdash;Dr.
Barberry, most of &rsquo;em call me. Say the word, and
I&rsquo;ll go with you and put up my salve against your
outfit, and we&rsquo;ll share and share alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, we have no room for an outsider,&rdquo;
returned Matt, while Andy nodded approvingly.
&ldquo;The wagon seat only holds two, and
besides, our plans are all completed for our
trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s face took on a sour look.
&ldquo;You are missing the chance of your lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; laughed Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can sell more salve than you can sell other
goods every day in the week&mdash;and make more
money, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you had better start alone&mdash;and at once,&rdquo;
returned Andy shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;if you fellers won&rsquo;t take me in as a
working partner. I made the suggestion only because
I thought it would be more pleasant to travel
in a company of three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are satisfied to go it without outside assistance,&rdquo;
cried Matt, as he hopped on the seat. &ldquo;All
ready, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go on,&rdquo; returned his partner, climbing up
beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t make a deal with me?&rdquo; questioned
Paul Barberry more sourly than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Matt and Andy in a breath, and
while one gathered up the lines the other spoke to
the horse, and the turn-out began to leave the
stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; shouted Paul Barberry. &ldquo;You may
be sorry for it. You young fellows think you know
it all, but you may get tripped up badly before
long,&rdquo; and picking up an ancient and decidedly
rusty traveling-bag which he possessed, the corn
salve doctor trudged away up the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a forward man!&rdquo; exclaimed Matt, as they
moved off. &ldquo;Why, he actually wanted to force
himself on us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a good many such fellows on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
road,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;The moment they see
some one who appears to be prospering, they try
their best to get in with him. I dare say that
Dr. Paul Barberry is about broke, and would
consider it a windfall of fortune to be taken in by
the owners and managers of the Eureka Auction
Co.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;ll meet him again,&rdquo; mused Matt,
as he looked back just in time to see the shabby
figure disappear around a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he may turn up again; such fellows very
often do,&rdquo; replied Andy.</p>
<p>But neither he nor Matt dreamed of the peculiar
circumstances under which they would again come
in contact with Paul Barberry.</p>
<p>The day was warm and bright, and Billy, the
horse, appeared in excellent spirits by the way he
trotted along over the macadamized road from
Newark to Elizabeth.</p>
<p>It was not their intention to stop at the latter
place, but just as they reached the outskirts of the
city Billy began to limp, and they saw that one of
his shoes had become loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take him around to a blacksmith
shop,&rdquo; said Andy, and they accordingly drove on
until such a place was reached.</p>
<p>Here they found they would have to wait until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
dinner-time before the shoe could be refitted.
Rather than go to the trouble and expense of getting
a license, however, they decided to spend the
time in walking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the oldest towns in New Jersey,&rdquo;
remarked Andy, as they walked around the depots
and down Broad Street, the main thoroughfare.
&ldquo;Down along the water front is one of the largest
sewing machine factories in the world. I was
through it once and I can tell you it was a sight
well worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just before twelve o&rsquo;clock they stopped in a
restaurant not far from the blacksmith shop, and
had dinner. By the time this was over Billy&rsquo;s shoe
had been readjusted, and once more they were off.</p>
<p>It was easy driving along the smooth country
road, and after passing through Cranford, Westfield
and several smaller places, they struck out for
Plainfield, which Andy declared was to be their
first regular stopping place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fair-sized city,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if we can
strike the right stand we ought to do well there for
several days or a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we do well,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;We need
a good start, for as yet our ready funds are rather
low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have your first chance to do a bit of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
regular auctioneering,&rdquo; smiled Andy. &ldquo;I trust you
are not nervous over the prospects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind if I am,&rdquo; returned Matt bravely.
&ldquo;I am going to do my best. If I get nervous I&rsquo;ll
get over it just as quickly as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time before sundown they entered Plainfield;
half an hour later they found a suitable stopping
place, and then Andy went off to secure some
stand where they might do business.</p>
<p>He came back in an hour and stated that he had
secured an empty store, which would be much
better than selling from the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The store will only cost us a dollar a day as
long as we use it, and we ought to be able to make
that much more out of it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They went to work that night transferring the
stock from the wagon to the store shelves, and when
this was finished both set to work to wash and dress
the show window.</p>
<p>On the following morning at ten o&rsquo;clock, they
hung out a red flag, and then the Eureka Auction
Co. was ready for business.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>THE YOUNG AUCTIONEER.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like a cat in a strange garret!&rdquo; exclaimed
Matt, as he walked up and down behind the counter
on a raised platform he and Andy had placed there.
&ldquo;This is like going into cold water an inch at a
time. I would rather plunge in head first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here goes,&rdquo; cried Andy, catching up an
accordion that stood close at hand. &ldquo;Let us see
what we can do toward drawing a crowd in. There
must be something going on, for the streets are
filling up with people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a cheap circus to exhibit. I saw the
posters. Perhaps they intend to give a parade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely. Get your banjo, Matt, and let us
give them our best selection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt did as requested; and as the music rang
out those on the pavement began to pause, and
half a dozen stopped at the open door and peered
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right in! Come right in!&rdquo; shouted Andy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
&ldquo;The auction is now about to begin, and you don&rsquo;t
want to miss the chance of your lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of room for everybody!&rdquo; shouted Matt
directly after him. His voice was a trifle unsteady
through excitement. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait outside, but
secure a good place, where you can hear and see all
that is going on. You need not buy if you do not
wish. One more tune, ladies and gentlemen, and
then we will show you the best bargains ever
exhibited in this city. That&rsquo;s right, come right
in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, the folks began to drift in, singly and
in pairs, until, when the next tune was finished, the
store held perhaps twenty-five men, women and
boys. Several children had tried to enter, but
Andy had shook his head at them, and thus kept
them outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s them pocket-knives worth?&rdquo; asked
one old man evidently from the country, as he
pointed to a board stuck full of the glittering
blades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which knife, sir?&rdquo; asked Matt, in a business-like
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one with the buckhorn handle and prunin&rsquo;
blade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sir, is one of our best knives. Well made,
of the best steel, and one that ought to last you a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
good many years. What do you offer for it,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offer?&rdquo; repeated the old man in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, make an offer, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you got no price sot on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; this is an auction store, and we take
what we can get for a thing. Come, make an
offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give ye a quarter for it,&rdquo; said the old man
after considerable hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter I am offered for this beautiful knife!&rdquo;
shouted Matt, taking up the blade and holding it
up so that all might see it. &ldquo;It is a knife with four
strong blades, a buckhorn handle, well riveted, and
extra-tempered springs, fully warranted. A quarter,
ladies and gentlemen; who says thirty cents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty!&rdquo; returned a young man, after an examination
of the knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty cents I am offered. Thirty! thirty!
Some one make it thirty-five&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-five cents!&rdquo; put in the old countryman.
&ldquo;I guess that knife is wuth that to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty!&rdquo; said the young man promptly. He
appeared to be rich, and was bidding more to tease
the old countryman than because he desired the
knife.</p>

THE YOUNG AUCTIONEERS AT WORK. <span class='illustrator'>Y. A.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forty I am offered!&rdquo; sang out Matt, who did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
not care who obtained the knife, so long as a good
figure was reached. &ldquo;Forty! forty! Come, gentlemen,
a bit higher than that, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five cents, and that&rsquo;s more than a good
price,&rdquo; grumbled the old countryman, who had,
however, set his heart on the knife the moment he
had first seen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dollar!&rdquo; sang out the young man
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty cents I am offered!&rdquo; went on Matt, in a
business-like way. &ldquo;Fifty cents, gentlemen, for a
knife that ought to be in every one&rsquo;s pocket&mdash;a
knife worth having! Who says seventy-five!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt knew very well that no one in the crowd
would make such a jump, but he hoped to cause the
old man to bid again, and his hope was realized.
Instead of going to fifty-five, the countryman
offered sixty cents.</p>
<p>He had hardly made the offer when the young
man, thinking he had aroused the old man to a
state of recklessness in which he would keep on bidding,
offered seventy-five cents for the knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five cents I am offered!&rdquo; cried Matt.
&ldquo;Who makes it a dollar&mdash;ninety&mdash;eight-five&mdash;eighty?&rdquo;
and he glanced inquiringly at the old
countryman.</p>
<p>But the old man shook his head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a penny over seventy-five cents,&rdquo; he muttered
in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five!&rdquo; went on Matt. &ldquo;Come, now,
raise it just a bit! The knife is really worth it.
Who says eighty? Seventy-five-five-five! Last
call, remember! Going, going&mdash;gone! to that young
man for seventy-five cents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Matt held out the knife to the last bidder,
and motioned to Andy to collect the money.</p>
<p>The young man grew red and drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! I didn&rsquo;t want the knife!&rdquo; he grumbled.
&ldquo;Put it up again, maybe you&rsquo;ll get a bigger
price for it,&rdquo; and he began to edge his way toward
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Not so fast!&rdquo; said Andy, in a low
voice, as he caught him by the arm. &ldquo;This company
doesn&rsquo;t do business that way. If you did not
wish the knife you should not have bid for it. We
are not running this store for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked at him impudently. But
the clear, stern eyes of Matt&rsquo;s partner made him
wilt, and muttering something under his breath
about getting square, he paid over the amount, took
the knife, and sneaked out of the now crowded
store.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the old countryman was about
to leave, disappointed over his failure to secure the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
prize he coveted. He wished just such a knife, and
knew that he would have to pay a dollar or more at
the hardware store for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, please,&rdquo; said Matt to him. &ldquo;I
have another such a knife. If you wish it you can
have it at the same figure that the young man
paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look at the knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countryman made a careful examination of
the blade, and finally agreed to take it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send my son Tom around for an accordion,&rdquo;
he said, before leaving. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead stuck on
music, Tom is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, we shall be pleased to see him,&rdquo; returned
Matt politely, and the old countryman went
off much pleased over the way he had been treated.</p>
<p>At a word from Andy, Matt brought the entire
board of knives out so that all might examine
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five cents was the auction price,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;So any one can step up and take his
or her choice for that amount. They are well
worth your inspection. Any of the knives will
stick, but you can&rsquo;t get stuck on a single one of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little joke made the crowd laugh, and a
dozen or more pressed forward to look at the knives.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
One young man bought a pearl-handled article, and
a young lady bought one which contained a lead
pencil and a button-hook.</p>
<p>While Matt was making these sales Andy was
busy showing off the merits of several articles of
bric-a-brac which a bevy of ladies were admiring.
He told them how he had obtained them at a sacrifice
sale, and was thus enabled to sell them quite
reasonable. The lady who led the party did not
wish to bid on the articles at auction, so Andy very
obligingly set a figure, and after some little
haggling, the lady took three dollars&rsquo; worth of
goods, to be delivered at her house on the outskirts
of the city.</p>
<p>By this time both of the young auctioneers were
certain that they were going to have a good day&rsquo;s
sales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That circus has brought the people out,&rdquo; whispered
Andy to Matt. &ldquo;We were very fortunate to
strike here when we did. We must make the most
of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I try next?&rdquo; asked Matt. &ldquo;I have
sold four of the knives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try something small, for they won&rsquo;t want to
carry bulky packages with them. I see there are a
lot of young fellows drifting in. You might get
out the mouth harmonicas and interest them in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
them. I&rsquo;ll show those ladies the jewelry, and try
to make some more private sales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Matt agreed, and he was soon playing a
lively air that caused all of the young men and
boys to gather around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one can play if he has music in him and
such an instrument as this in his possession,&rdquo; he
argued, after he had finished. &ldquo;To show that it is
all right and in perfect tune, I will put up the one
I have been playing upon. How much am I
offered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten cents!&rdquo; cried a boy standing close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten cents I am offered. Ten ce&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt got no farther, for at that moment a loud
cry upon the street drowned out every other sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for the bear! He is mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is coming this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scatter for your lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and a hundred other cries rent the air.
Then came a crash of window glass, and the next
moment a huge brown bear leaped into the show
window, not over two yards away from where Matt
was standing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>THE CHARMS OF MUSIC.</h3>
</div>
<p>For the moment after the brown bear crashed
through the glass and landed in the show window
of the auction store Matt was too astonished to
move.</p>
<p>The entrance of the great beast, which had undoubtedly
escaped from the circus men during the
parade, was so totally unexpected that all in the
place were too paralyzed with fear to move.</p>
<p>Screams of terror rent the air, and to these the
brown bear added a growl which was both deep
and angry.</p>
<p>Andy, who stood some distance behind Matt, was
the first to do any rational talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab the pistol, Matt!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Grab it
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weapon to which Andy referred was lying
under the counter, just in front of the boy. It had
been purchased by the firm and placed there in case
some ugly person raised a dispute, or a sneak-thief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
tried to run off with any article. Andy had said
that the mere sight of a pistol would often bring
matters to terms when words had no effect.</p>
<p>Matt understood his partner&rsquo;s cry, and he lost no
time in acting upon it. He caught up the pistol,
and at once aimed it at the bear&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Whether or not the beast understood that his life
was in danger would be hard to say, but no sooner
had the weapon been pointed at him than he arose
on his hind legs and emitted a growl that was fairly
blood-curdling to the involuntary listeners.</p>
<p>Matt did not claim to be a crack shot, having had
but slight experience in pistol practice, and, even in
that moment of peril, he hesitated to shoot, fearful
of missing the bear and striking some one on the
sidewalk outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear the way out there!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Clear the
way, or you may get shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words had the effect of scattering the few
venturesome persons who had collected to see what
the bear might do. In the meantime those in the
store ran out of the open doors as quickly as they
could. Andy alone remained with his partner,
arming himself with the longest carving-knife the
stock afforded.</p>
<p>Once on his hind legs the brown bear hesitated
in his movements. He was separated from Matt by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
five feet of space between the show window and the
raised platform upon which the boy stood. He did
not seem to wish to leap the span, nor did he appear
inclined to step down to the floor and then up upon
the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let him have it?&rdquo; yelled Andy,
as he saw Matt raise the pistol and then lower it
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s so mad after all,&rdquo; returned
the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to shoot until I have to.
Say!&rdquo; he went on suddenly, &ldquo;give him a tune on
one of the accordions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; gasped Andy in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play him a tune. He may be a trained bear,
and if so, the music may soothe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy at once caught Matt&rsquo;s idea, and, taking up
an accordion which stood close at hand, he began a
lively tune of a popular sort.</p>
<p>At the first bars of the tune the brown bear appeared
surprised. He raised himself up higher than
ever on his hind legs, until his head touched the top
of the show window. Then he started as if to
dance, crashing over every article which was on
exhibition. Finding he could not dance in the
limited space around him, he leaped to the pavement
outside, and there, to the bystanders&rsquo; amazement
and relief, began to execute a clumsy jig.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dancing, sure enough!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;That
was a good idea of yours, Matt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up until his keepers come,&rdquo; returned
the boy. &ldquo;Lively, now, Andy, for playing means
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy continued to play, and as the brown bear
began to dance more heartily than ever, the people,
who a moment before had been so frightened, gathered
about and began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than shooting him,&rdquo; remarked one
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it is,&rdquo; returned another. &ldquo;Keep it up,
young fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Andy did keep it up until two keepers appeared,
hatless and almost out of breath, and took
the bear in charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doxie would have been all right,&rdquo; one of them
explained; &ldquo;but while he was performing on the
square below some mischievous boy threw some
pepper in his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Doxie went after him,&rdquo; added the
other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for the boy that he got out of
sight, for had Doxie caught him he would have
chewed him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very thankful that he did not do any further
damage,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;I thought I would have
to shoot him,&rdquo; and he exhibited the pistol.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky for you that you didn&rsquo;t shoot Doxie,&rdquo;
cried the head keeper. &ldquo;You would have been a
couple of hundred out of pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;Who is
going to pay for that smashed show window and the
ruined goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the faces of the two keepers fell. The
brown bear had been in their keeping, and they
knew that the proprietor of the circus would hold
them responsible for any damage done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is not our fault,&rdquo; returned the head
keeper blandly. &ldquo;I reckon you will have to bear
the loss yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, not!&rdquo; cried Matt. &ldquo;The owner of this
bear will pay every cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on and see him, then,&rdquo; returned the
keeper curtly, and throwing a chain over the bear&rsquo;s
head, he started to lead the animal away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Andy quietly but firmly. &ldquo;You
will not take that bear away until this matter is
settled. Matt, see if you can find a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A policeman was close at hand, and he was at
once summoned. A long altercation followed, in
which the keepers tried to disown any responsibility
in the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom does the bear belong to?&rdquo; questioned
Andy at last.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Menville, the proprietor of the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you leave him here until Mr. Menville
comes for him,&rdquo; was the quick reply. &ldquo;Mr. Officer,
please see to it that the bear is not taken away. I
think he might very easily be chained to that hitching-post
by the curb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; Oi dunno about this!&rdquo; exclaimed the
policeman, an old Irishman. &ldquo;Ye had better let
him take the baste away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;ll stay here until damages are settled,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;They do not own the bear, and if
they attempt to take him away arrest them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy did not know if he was acting according to
law or not, and, for that matter, neither did the
policeman. But the auctioneer&rsquo;s firm stand had the
desired effect, for the two keepers presently weakened,
and asked what it would cost to replace the
window and the goods spoiled.</p>
<p>A glazier was called in, and while he was figuring
Matt and Andy went over the stock. At the end
of ten minutes it was found that sixteen dollars
would cover all loss. With much grumbling the
circus men paid the amount, and they were then
permitted to lead the brown bear away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a bit of excitement, I must say,&rdquo; was
Matt&rsquo;s comment after it was all over. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to go through any such scare again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;But, see, there is
quite a crowd gathered around yet. Let us make
the most of the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too unstrung to auction off any stuff,&rdquo; admitted
Matt. &ldquo;That first scare was enough to take
the heart right out of a fellow. You go ahead if
you wish, and I&rsquo;ll clean out the window and get
things ready for that new frame and glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So without further delay Andy began to address
the people, and soon he had the store once more
filled. He kept on auctioning stuff off until one
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when the crowd thinned
out, being composed principally of folks who had
come into the city to visit the circus.</p>
<p>By that time Matt had set the carpenter and the
glazier to work, and the new woodwork and the
glass were in. All it needed was a couple of coats
of paint, and the show window would be as good as
new. The owner of the building, having heard of
the affair, came around to view the situation, and
expressed himself perfectly satisfied with what had
been done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m glad you made them pay up on the
spot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For if those circus people had
been allowed to leave town I would never have
gotten a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to show his gratitude, he bought a razor and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
strop for himself, and a pair of scissors for his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will not be much doing now until evening,&rdquo;
said Andy to Matt. &ldquo;So we will have
dinner and then one of us can deliver those articles
that lady bought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deliver the stuff, Andy. I fancy the walk
will brace me up more than anything else would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on then,&rdquo; said Andy, and so, after he
had had dinner, Matt set out with the bundle of
goods under his arm.</p>
<p>The way to the lady&rsquo;s house led past the circus,
and with a natural curiosity to see what was going
on, Matt pushed his way through the crowd to
where a number of banners were stretched containing
vivid pictures of the many wonderful sights
which the ticket seller said could be seen within.</p>
<p>The boy was much interested in the slick way of
speaking which the ticket seller had, and to &ldquo;gain
points,&rdquo; as he called it, for the auction business, he
remained almost an hour listening to all that was said.</p>
<p>He was about to leave the crowd when a well-dressed
man who was standing beside him pushed
him a bit to one side, and then stooped to pick something
from the ground at Matt&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>It was a large pocket-book, and apparently well
filled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>THE CONFIDENCE MAN.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! look at that!&rdquo; cried the man, in a low
tone, as he picked up the pocket-book and surveyed
it. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a find, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;How much is
there in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me and I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said the man, and
without waiting for Matt to offer a reply, he caught
the boy by the arm, and forced him through the
crowd to an open spot behind a large tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to know who lost this,&rdquo; went on
the man, as he opened the flap of the pocket-book,
and gazed inside at the contents. &ldquo;By Jove! look
at that pile of bills!&rdquo; he went on, as he turned the
pocket-book around so that Matt might catch sight
of what certainly did look like twenty-five or thirty
bank bills tucked away in one of the pockets.
&ldquo;Must be a hundred dollars or more in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of that pocket-book will miss it,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
returned Matt. &ldquo;You ought to make an effort to
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! of course!&rdquo; assented the man heartily.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to keep anybody&rsquo;s money&mdash;not
if I know it is theirs. Let me see if there is a card
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned the pocket-book around and put his
fingers first in one pocket and then another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a blessed thing but that pile of bills,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t that strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he suddenly drew from his vest pocket a
gold watch and looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarter to three!&rdquo; he exclaimed in a startled
tone. &ldquo;And I must catch the three o&rsquo;clock train
for Baltimore! I haven&rsquo;t time to look up the
owner of this pocket-book, valuable as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might take a later train,&rdquo; suggested
Matt.</p>
<p>The man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have an engagement in Baltimore immediately
upon the arrival of this train which I would
not miss for a dozen such pocket-books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to take the money with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t feel just right about doing that,&rdquo; returned
the man with a bland smile. &ldquo;I would feel
like a thief. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do,&rdquo; he went
on smoothly and earnestly. &ldquo;Give me twenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
dollars, and you take the pocket-book. Perhaps
you won&rsquo;t be able to find an owner, and then the
money will all be yours, and if you do find an owner,
he will certainly offer more of a reward than twenty
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take the pocket-book?&rdquo; said Matt, considerably
surprised by the offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I really can&rsquo;t wait, and I do not feel satisfied
to take that money with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, supposing I do not find the owner, do you
not want part of the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you can keep it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This certainly seemed a very liberal offer, and
had Matt had less experience of the world at large,
he might have accepted on the spot. But the apparent
open-heartedness of the stranger only served
to make him more cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us count the money and see how much there
is in the pocket-book,&rdquo; he remarked, hardly knowing
what else to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t time to do that,&rdquo; said the stranger
hastily. &ldquo;As it is, I have now barely ten minutes
in which to get to the depot. If you want to accept
my offer, give me the twenty dollars, and I&rsquo;ll run
for the depot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man moved around as if in the greatest
hurry of his life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t twenty dollars with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! I thought you looked like a well-to-do
young man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have twelve dollars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;let that do, but be quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the stranger held out his hand for the
amount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; remarked Matt, struck with an
idea which he resolved to carry out if he went into
the scheme at all. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the money from the
pocket-book, and if I find the owner I will tell him
how I came to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t you touch the contents of the pocket-book!&rdquo;
exclaimed the stranger, hastily snatching
the article in question from Matt&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;That
would not be right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I will make it right with the owner,
if I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait any longer for that train!&rdquo; cried
the stranger, and without another word he placed
the pocket-book into his coat-pocket and disappeared
into the crowd.</p>
<p>For the instant Matt stared after him, and then a
light burst upon the boy&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a confidence man and was trying to
swindle me!&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;If that
pocket-book contained much it was a single dollar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
bill on a pile of green paper! How lucky I was not
to jump at his offer when he first made it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he had reached this conclusion, Matt
made after the man. But the crowd was too thick
and too large to find him, and after a quarter of an
hour&rsquo;s search the young auctioneer gave it up.</p>
<p>It was now getting late, and as soon as he was
satisfied that the confidence man was gone, Matt
hurried along on his errand.</p>
<p>He found that the lady who had purchased the
goods had just reached home. She had heard of the
brown bear episode, and insisted upon Matt giving
her the particulars, which he did. She was very
much interested in his story, and after she had heard
how the affair terminated she plied him with questions
concerning the auction business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may think me very curious,&rdquo; she said at
length. &ldquo;But the reason I ask is because my only
son, Tom Inwold, ran away with a traveling auctioneer
about three months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran away?&rdquo; repeated Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he got into a difficulty in school, and when
I insisted that he apologize to his teachers, he grew
angry and left the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom was fifteen last May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very young to become an auctioneer,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
smiled Matt. &ldquo;I am hardly old enough for the
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has made a friend of this auctioneer&mdash;who
used to stand up in a wagon and sing songs, and
then sell cheap jewelry&mdash;and he went off with him
one Saturday, when I thought he had gone to New
York with his uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t he want to come back?&rdquo; asked
Matt, deeply interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never heard of him since he went away.&rdquo;
Mrs. Inwold put her handkerchief to her eyes to
dry the tears which had started. &ldquo;One reason I
wished these goods delivered was because I thought
I might get a chance to talk to you about Tom.
You intend to travel from place to place, do you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam; we shall remain here but a few
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, perhaps, in your travels you may run
across Tom. If you do I wish you would tell him
to send word home. He ought to come home of
himself, but I suppose he won&rsquo;t do that, he is so
headstrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think he would prefer a good home to
traveling around with a cheap jewelry man,&rdquo; was
Matt&rsquo;s comment, as he looked around at the comfortable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
house Mrs. Inwold occupied. &ldquo;I know I
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys do not always know what is best for
them,&rdquo; sighed the lady. &ldquo;Tom generally had his
own way, and that made him headstrong. He is
my only son, and as his father is away most of the
time, I suppose I treated him more indulgently than
was good for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea where he and the jewelry
man went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest. I notified the police and
sent out several detectives, but could learn nothing.
The detectives told me that the jewelry man was
little better than a thief, and always covered his
tracks when he left a city, so that his victims could
not trace him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most likely true. But I trust you do
not take my partner and me for such fellows,&rdquo;
added Matt honestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you look like a young gentleman, and the
other young man was one, too, I feel sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We try to do things on the square. We never
willfully misrepresent what we sell&mdash;as many do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is right, and if you keep on that way you
will be bound to prosper. No one ever yet gained
much by resorting to trickery in trying to get
along.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Inwold talked to Matt for quite awhile after
this, and promised to come down to the store and
buy several other articles of which she thought she
stood in need. It was nearly five o&rsquo;clock when the
boy left the mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very nice lady,&rdquo; thought Matt, as he hurried
back to the auction store. &ldquo;I hope I meet her son
Tom some day. I&rsquo;ll tell him how she feels about
his going away, and advise him to return home
without delay. My gracious! you wouldn&rsquo;t catch
me leaving a home like that in order to put up with
the hardships of the road!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE STORM.</h3>
</div>
<p>That evening Matt and Andy were kept busy
until nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock selling goods to people
that came from the circus. They put up nearly
every kind of article on their shelves, and only
about half the stock remained unsold when they
finally closed and locked the doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That circus was a windfall to us!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy. &ldquo;We would not have done half as well had
it not been in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it would be a good idea to follow up the
circus,&rdquo; suggested Matt. &ldquo;That seems to draw out
the people more than anything else I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will follow the circus as much as we can,
Matt. But there is one thing I must do first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the first train back to New York in the
morning and buy more goods. Some of our best
sellers are entirely gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then go by all means,&rdquo; returned Matt quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you get along alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. If I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll lock up till you get
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. Now let us go over the stock
and I&rsquo;ll make out a list of what&rsquo;s wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us figure up what we have made,&rdquo; returned
Matt quickly, for he was anxious to know what the
exact amount would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I would like to know myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a sheet of paper they had kept a record of
every article sold, with the price. Opposite these,
Andy, who was more familiar with their cost than
Matt, placed the amount of profit on each. Then
with his partner leaning over his shoulder, he added
the column up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-one dollars and a quarter!&rdquo; exclaimed
Matt, as he surveyed the result of Andy&rsquo;s calculations.
&ldquo;Did we really make as much as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did. Of course we must take out our personal
expenses and Billy&rsquo;s keep. That amounts to
four dollars and a quarter nearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That still leaves twenty-seven dollars for one
day&rsquo;s work. At this rate we&rsquo;ll get rich fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not expect such luck every day, Matt.
Remember, to-day was circus day. We will have
rainy days, and days spent in traveling, during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
which we will not take in anything, while our
expenses go on just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a good thing we didn&rsquo;t have that kind
of a start, Andy. We would have been &lsquo;busted&rsquo;
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right there,&rdquo; returned Andy.</p>
<p>By seven o&rsquo;clock on the following morning he
was on the way to New York, leaving Matt to open
the store alone. This the young auctioneer did,
and as trade was very quiet, Matt spent the time in
cleaning up such goods as had been handled, and
tidying up generally.</p>
<p>Compared with the day before, the street was
almost deserted, but during the noon hour, when
people were going to and coming from dinner, Matt
managed to start up a sale which lasted until nearly
two o&rsquo;clock, and by which he disposed of over three
dollars&rsquo; worth of goods at a good profit.</p>
<p>It was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock when Andy returned.
He had rushed matters in New York, but had
bought several bargains, especially one in imitation
cut glassware, which, when it arrived the next day,
made a pretty showing in the window.</p>
<p>They remained in Plainfield two days longer, and
then loaded their wagon once more and started on
the road. They made brief stops at Bound Brook
and Somerville, doing fairly well at both places,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
and then, just ten days after leaving the city, struck
Flemington.</p>
<p>At this latter place they again came across Menville&rsquo;s
circus, and as a consequence did a big day&rsquo;s
business. They intended to leave Flemington on
the day following, but after talking the matter over
decided to remain until the following Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Monday morning you can strike across the
country for High Bridge alone, if you will,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;I can take another trip to New York, and
buy more goods and have them shipped direct to
that place, or else on to Phillipsburg, which shall
be our last stopping place in New Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Matt agreed, and on Saturday night
all was made ready for an early morning start on
Monday. Sunday was a quiet day for both, although
they attended divine services, and took a long walk
among the farms outside of the town proper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By creation! but it looks like a storm,&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy, on Monday morning, as he jumped
out of bed and aroused Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it rains we will have to make the most
of it, I suppose,&rdquo; returned the boy philosophically.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we haven&rsquo;t any umbrellas to sell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I&rsquo;ll put them on the list at once!&rdquo; cried
Andy, with a laugh. &ldquo;I declare, Matt, you are getting
to be more of a business man every day.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If I am it&rsquo;s because I have such a good partner
for a teacher, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; returned the young man, but
nevertheless considerably pleased to learn that Matt
appreciated his efforts. &ldquo;You are as bright as any
one on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they went down to the dining-room of the
hotel at which they were stopping it certainly did
look like rain. Yet there was a brisk breeze blowing,
and several expressed themselves as certain that
it would pass around to the north of them.</p>
<p>Less than half an hour later Andy was on his way
to the depot to catch a train, and Matt hurried to
the stable where Billy and the wagon were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get to High Bridge just as soon as I can,&rdquo;
he said to himself. &ldquo;I have no desire to be caught
in a thunder-storm on a strange country road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may get a bit wet, but that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; remarked
the stable-keeper, as he saw the boy glance at the
heavy clouds scurrying across the sky. &ldquo;That there
storm, if it comes, which is doubtful, won&rsquo;t last half
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this reassurance, if such it could be called,
Matt saw to it that all was in good condition, and
sprang upon the seat. He had made careful inquiries
concerning the road, so that he might not go
astray&mdash;a thing easy to do in most parts of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
country&mdash;and in a short space of time he was out of
the town and on the turnpike.</p>
<p>Had it been a pleasant day the boy would have
enjoyed that drive thoroughly, for it was through
a most beautiful section of the country. On both
sides of the road were broad fields, dotted here and
there with patches of woods and bushes. Several
brooks were also crossed, and at one of these he
stopped for a few minutes to watch a trio of boys
fishing.</p>
<p>But then the sky seemed to grow darker suddenly,
and somewhat alarmed, Matt whipped up Billy.
The wind died out utterly, and the air grew close
and sultry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means a heavy thunder-storm and nothing
less,&rdquo; thought Matt. &ldquo;I wish I was near the
journey&rsquo;s end instead of only about half through
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently came a sudden and quite unexpected
rush of wind, and a second later a heavy dash of
rain, which drove almost into the boy&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>Matt at once stopped driving, and adjusted the
rubber blanket in front of his seat. This was no
easy job, for the wind kept increasing in violence.
He had barely completed the work when there came
a crash of thunder, and then the rain came down
harder than ever.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could find some shelter,&rdquo; he muttered
to himself. &ldquo;I would willingly pay to be allowed
to drive into some barn until this was over. I hope
none of the stock gets wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt tried to peer about him, but he could not
see far, owing to the sheets of rain which fell all
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to stick to the road until something
comes in sight, Billy,&rdquo; he said, addressing the shivering
horse. &ldquo;Get up old boy, and step lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus addressed, the animal started on once more.
But the rain prevented him going as fast as before.
The ground was very heavy, and the road in spots
was covered with water which had not time to run
off, so heavy was the downpour.</p>
<p>Presently they came to where the road ran
through a heavy bit of timber. Here it was almost
as dark as night, and the branches of the trees,
laden with water, hung down so low that many
swept the wagon as the turn-out went by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! I wish we were out of this!&rdquo; muttered
Matt, as he tried in vain to pierce the gloom ahead.
&ldquo;You must find the road, Billy, for I can&rsquo;t see
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>A terrific crash of thunder drowned out the last
words. Billy sprang forward in alarm, and away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
went the wagon over rocks and decaying tree
trunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; shouted Matt. &ldquo;Whoa, Billy, whoa!
You have left the road, old boy! Whoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now a blinding flash of lightning lit up the
scene, and then came another crash of thunder, even
louder than before. Billy reared up, and then came
down with a leap. On the instant he was off, like
a rocket, over bushes, logs and rocks, dragging the
swaying and creaking wagon after him!</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XVIII_A_HOLDUP' id='CHAPTER_XVIII_A_HOLDUP'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>A &ldquo;HOLD-UP.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>For the time being, Matt, on the seat of the
heavily-laden wagon, felt certain that the entire
turn-out must come to grief, and that very soon.
Billy, thoroughly frightened by the thunder and
lightning, was straining every nerve to make his
way through the woods, despite brush, stones, and
fallen trees.</p>
<p>Between the flashes of light the way beneath the
trees was almost totally dark. The rain swept this
way and that, and Matt, standing up on the foot-rest,
was soaked to the skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, Billy, old boy! Whoa!&rdquo; he called again.
&ldquo;You are all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the scared horse paid no attention to his call.
His nerves seemed to be strained to their utmost,
and on he plunged, dragging the wagon along with
bumps and jolts, which more than once threatened
to land the young auctioneer out on his head.</p>
<p>Realizing that something must be done quickly if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
he would save the wagon from becoming a total
wreck, Matt resolved upon a bold move. He tied
the reins to the dashboard, and then, with a swift
jump, cast himself upon Billy&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>For the instant the horse, worse frightened than
before, tore along over the uneven surface at a
greater rate of speed than ever. The wagon struck
a rock, and seemed about to lurch over upon its
side. But it righted, and seeing this, Matt began to
talk to the horse, patting him in the meanwhile
upon the neck in an affectionate way.</p>
<p>This show of kindness soon had more effect upon
Billy than anything which had previously been
done. The animal slackened his speed gradually,
and then, as there came a brief lull in the storm,
stopped short, almost winded, but still inclined to
go on at the first sign of further danger.</p>
<p>As soon as Billy had come to a halt Matt sprang
to the ground. A tree the boy had feared they
would collide with was close at hand, and to this he
tied the horse, making sure that the halter should
be well secured; and for the time being, the danger
of being wrecked through a runaway was over.</p>
<p>But the trouble was by no means past. The
storm still kept on, the lightning being as vivid as
ever, and the thunder causing Billy to tug violently
at the strap which held him. It was with a shiver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
that Matt wondered what the consequence would be
should that particular tree be struck by lightning.</p>
<p>To prevent Billy doing damage to the wagon by
twisting in the shafts or by kicking, Matt unharnessed
him and pushed the wagon back a few feet
into a somewhat open space. Here the rain came
down heavier, but he felt safer than in close proximity
to the tree.</p>
<p>Feeling that nothing was to be done until the
storm should abate, Matt climbed into the wagon
again and protected himself as well as he could
with the rubber blanket and the lap-robe. The
back shade of the wagon was down, and he was
glad to see that so far the stock inside had sustained
no damage.</p>
<p>A half-hour dragged along slowly. Several times
the storm appeared upon the point of clearing away,
but each time the clouds settled down heavier than
before, until under the trees it was as black as midnight.</p>
<p>Matt wondered how far he was from the road,
and if there were a farmhouse anywhere at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could reach a house of some sort it wouldn&rsquo;t
be so bad,&rdquo; he murmured to himself. &ldquo;But being
out here alone isn&rsquo;t any fun, that&rsquo;s certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the clouds seemed to scatter for good. A
fresh breeze stirred the trees and bushes, and ere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
long the rain ceased, although the drops still came
down from the heavily-laden branches overhead.</p>
<p>As soon as he felt certain that the sky was brightening
to remain so, Matt untied Billy, and harnessed
him to the wagon once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Billy, we&rsquo;ll get back to the road just as
fast as we can,&rdquo; he said to the horse. &ldquo;And I trust
that you will never run away again in that fashion,
old boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On all sides arose bushes and rocks, and, although
the road might be close at hand, Matt thought it
best to return the way they had come. He wished
to take no more chances, feeling that it would be
the easiest thing in the world to get lost, or to run
the turn-out into some hollow or hole from which
it would be next to impossible to extricate it.</p>
<p>But to return by the route they had come was
itself no easy task. In his terror, Billy had dragged
the heavy vehicle over several very uneven places,
full of stumps and rocks, and now the animal, still
somewhat exhausted, had all he could do to move
back over the trail which had been left.</p>
<p>Matt led the horse, and on more than one occasion
had to place his shoulder to the rear end of the
wagon to help over a particularly bad spot. Thus
they moved on, taking half an hour to cover a distance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
which had previously been traveled in less
than half that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness, we are out of that at last!&rdquo;
exclaimed Matt, as the road finally appeared in
sight. &ldquo;Now to see if any damage has been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young auctioneer made a minute examination
of every bolt and spring, as well as of the running
gear and harness. He was overjoyed to find everything
still in good order, despite the rough usage to
which it had been put. The wagon body was
scratched in a dozen places, but this could be easily
remedied.</p>
<p>The rubber blankets were put away, and the lap-robe
left fluttering in the rear to dry, and then
Matt once more resumed his lonely journey in the
direction of High Bridge.</p>
<p>The heavy rain had left the road deep with mud,
and through this Billy plodded slowly along, Matt
not having the heart to urge him to a greater speed,
knowing well that the faithful animal was doing as
well as could be reasonably expected of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we reach High Bridge I must find a
good stable for Billy, and change my clothes,&rdquo;
thought Matt. &ldquo;And something hot to drink won&rsquo;t
go bad, either. Ugh! I am chilled clear to the
bone!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>And he gave a shiver that was as genuine as it
was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The road now led downward and around a bend,
where was situated another heavy bit of timber.
As Matt approached the wood he saw some distance
back from the road a shanty built of rough logs
and boards, and thatched with weather-beaten
shingles and bits of old tin and oil-cloth. There
was a rude chimney upon the outside of the rear of
this shanty, and from this a thin cloud of smoke
was issuing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! here is somebody&rsquo;s home, but a very
poor one,&rdquo; thought Matt. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but
those inside got a pretty good soaking, by the looks
of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first the young auctioneer determined to stop,
but upon second thought, he concluded to go on,
satisfied that no accommodations worthy of the
name could be had there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t strike something better, I&rsquo;ll keep
right on to High Bridge,&rdquo; was his thought, and he
was just about to urge Billy on once more, when
the door of the shanty opened and a man came out.</p>
<p>The man was apparently fifty years of age, and
rough in looks. His beard was long, as was also
his hair, and both seemed to be much in need of
shears and brush. His clothing and his face were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
dirty, and altogether he presented a decidedly ill-favored
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, there, stranger!&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;Where
bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bound for High Bridge,&rdquo; replied Matt as he
drew rein. &ldquo;How many miles is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; was the rather indefinite reply.
&ldquo;Suppose you got cotched in that storm, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I got the full benefit of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a heavy one, no mistake about that.
What sort of a turn-out have you got there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An auction goods wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carrying stuff around the country to sell at
auction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Say, maybe you&rsquo;ve got something you
would like to sell me,&rdquo; and the man, after speaking
to some one in the shanty, stepped up closer to the
turn-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have, but it&rsquo;s pretty well packed up,&rdquo;
returned Matt, who was not at all taken by the
man&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be open at High Bridge this
evening, or to-morrow, if nothing happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We? Got somebody else with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on the wagon, but I have a partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. What line of goods do you carry?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>Matt named over a number of articles. The man&rsquo;s
eyes brightened as he listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have a pair of suspenders,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
need them worst way. And if you&rsquo;ve got a good
pocket-knife I&rsquo;ll patronize you so much more. Drive
up in the back of the house and tie fast anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, but I would prefer getting to High
Bridge. I am wet to the skin, and I want to change
my clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, young fellow. We&rsquo;ve got a fire
inside, and you can dry yourself there just as well
as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my horse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of the horse. I&rsquo;ve got a shed a
bit back of those bushes. Come on in; what are
you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, Matt sprang from the wagon seat to
the ground. As he did so he noted a look of satisfaction
gleam upon the man&rsquo;s dirty face, and he saw
the fellow wave his hand toward the shanty&rsquo;s one
window. He turned swiftly in the direction, and
was in time to see two equally repulsive heads dodge
aside out of sight.</p>
<p>Only for a second did the young auctioneer hesitate.
Then something warned him to beware of
danger, and he turned again to the wagon and placed
one foot upon the shaft step.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! what are you going to do?&rdquo; cried the man,
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I won&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; returned the boy. &ldquo;That
storm does not seem to be quite over, and I do not
wish to catch a second dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will stop, sonny!&rdquo; exclaimed the man,
with a sudden change of manner. &ldquo;Hi, Jake!
Baldy! Come out here and help me manage this
young fellow!&rdquo; he went on, in a louder tone.</p>
<p>The other men at once rushed from the shanty,
and in a trice Matt was surrounded.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XIX_OUT_OF_A_BAD_SCRAPE' id='CHAPTER_XIX_OUT_OF_A_BAD_SCRAPE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>OUT OF A BAD SCRAPE.</h3>
</div>
<p>It did not take the young auctioneer long to understand
the true nature of the situation in which
he now found himself. The three men who had
surrounded him were nothing more or less than
tramps who had undoubtedly sought shelter in the
shanty from the storm. That they were thoroughly
unscrupulous men went without saying, and it must
be confessed that Matt&rsquo;s heart sank within him as
he realized the danger in which he was placed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; he said sternly to the first man,
who had presumed to catch him by the arm. &ldquo;Let
go, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, Crabs!&rdquo; put in the tramp called
Jake. &ldquo;Hold tight to him while I tie up the hoss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo; demanded Matt, as
he struggled to free himself, but in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn fast enough, sonny,&rdquo; returned Crabs,
with a wicked grin. &ldquo;Just keep quiet now, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall not!&rdquo; retorted the young auctioneer
hotly. &ldquo;Do you suppose I am going to
submit tamely to being robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said anything about robbin&rsquo; you?&rdquo; demanded
the third tramp, he called Baldy, although
his head was covered with a shock of hair twice as
thick as either of his companions. &ldquo;You had better
act civil-like, sonny, if you want to get off without
a licking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let me go!&rdquo; went on Matt, paying no attention
to the last remark. &ldquo;Let go, I say&mdash;or take
the consequences!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The consequences?&rdquo; sneered him called Crabs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without further warning, Matt drew back
with his clinched fist and gave the tramp a stinging
blow between the eyes, which caused the much surprised
individual to let go his hold and stagger back
to the shanty&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho&mdash;what&mdash;what do you mean by hitting me?&rdquo;
he howled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you to let go,&rdquo; retorted Matt; and free
from his tormentor, he essayed to leap to the wagon
seat and gain possession of the heavy whip, with
which he might keep the tramps at bay.</p>
<p>But hardly had he placed his foot on the rest than
Baldy, who was now close at hand, caught him by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
the ankle and gave a sudden jerk, which brought
Matt down on his chest and face, scratching his left
cheek in two places, and giving him a severe shaking
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold the horse, Jake!&rdquo; cried Baldy. &ldquo;Hold the
horse, and I&rsquo;ll hold the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me get at him!&rdquo; cried Crabs, in a rage.
&ldquo;Just let me get at him, and I&rsquo;ll teach him to strike
me between the eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he rushed past his companion, and
was on the point of kicking Matt in the side when
Baldy stopped him with a side dig of his ragged
elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike him if it ain&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold him all right enough. Come, be still
now,&rdquo; he went on to the young auctioneer.</p>
<p>Matt was on his face on the ground and Baldy
was sitting on top of him, but, nevertheless, the boy
did not intend to give up the struggle.</p>
<p>He squirmed and twisted this way and that until
finally free, and then, before the tramp could catch
him again, he sprang to his feet and leaped upon
the foot-rest of the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back there, all of you!&rdquo; he cried determinedly,
and the next instant had the whip and was
flourishing it over the heads of those below him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that! he&rsquo;s got away from you!&rdquo; cried Crabs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
to Baldy, in tones of deep disgust. &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t
you wish you had let me tend to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick to the horse, Jake!&rdquo; cried Baldy, ignoring
the last remark. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon have the young fellow
on the ground again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of that horse!&rdquo; commanded Matt. &ldquo;Let
go, or I&rsquo;ll lash you right and left!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tramp called Jake looked up into the young
auctioneer&rsquo;s face at these words. Evidently he did
not like the looks of the set lines about Matt&rsquo;s
mouth, for without delay he obeyed the order, and
stepped back. Lie had hardly done so before Matt
struck Billy a light blow, and off went the horse at
quite a respectable gait, leaving the three would-be
plunderers standing staring after the turn-out in
wonder and disgust!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! but that was a narrow escape!&rdquo; gasped
Matt, to himself, as he caught up the lines and gave
Billy another tap. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to be thankful
that I was not robbed of everything in my
keeping. Those fellows looked wicked enough to
do almost anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had gone on some little distance he
leaned out of the wagon to see if he was being pursued.
But the tramps had deemed it unwise to
follow him, and once more the young auctioneer
had the road to himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>It was not long before the houses of High Bridge
appeared in sight. At the first place the young
auctioneer asked for directions to the hotel, and
here he had the wagon and horse safely stabled,
and then went to the room which had been assigned
to him to change every article of clothing
he wore.</p>
<p>He had ordered a hot meal to be served, and
when he came down he found the table spread for
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got caught in the shower, eh?&rdquo; questioned the
hotel-keeper, as Matt sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned the boy, and he related
the particulars of his adventures while eating, not
forgetting to mention the three tramps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those three rascals have been bothering folks
around here for quite a bit,&rdquo; remarked the hotel-keeper
after he had finished. &ldquo;The constable is
after &rsquo;em now, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll catch &rsquo;em, for
they slide around from place to place. You can bet
on it that they are miles away from that shanty by
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I trust that I never fall in with them
again,&rdquo; returned Matt with a slight shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to hold an auction?&rdquo; went on the hotel-keeper
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I expect to do. I would like to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
some good spot. Where would be the best place
for me to locate, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hotel-keeper thought for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, most of the folks come around here and
over across the way to the general stores. But
I reckon the store-keepers won&rsquo;t like you around
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never do&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;ve got
to make a living as well as they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Tell you what you might do.
There&rsquo;s the old paint-shop next door. You can use
that for an auction place if you are a mind to be
liberal for the use of it,&rdquo; said the hotel-keeper.</p>
<p>As soon as he had finished Matt went out and inspected
the old paint-shop. He found it would do
very well for his purpose, and on returning offered
the hotel-keeper a good pocket-knife for its use for
the following day. This offer was at once accepted,
and Matt set to work without delay to get the place
into shape.</p>
<p>By nightfall he was ready for business. In the
meantime, he had sent a couple of small boys
around to all the houses in the neighborhood to
notify the folks of the sale, and as a consequence,
by eight o&rsquo;clock he had the shop quite comfortably
filled.</p>
<p>Without waiting to see if Andy might return on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
the late evening train, Matt started up business, and
inside of half an hour had matters in full swing.
He opened up with a lot of goods which the folks
appeared to need, and they sold readily, much to the
disgust of one of the proprietors of the regular stores,
who came over to see what was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! it&rsquo;s only a boy!&rdquo; he muttered, but
loud enough for all to hear. &ldquo;What does he know
about the goods he is selling? Like as not they are
second-handed, and all shop-worn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These goods are strictly new, and of the latest
designs,&rdquo; called out Matt, looking squarely at the
man. &ldquo;They are direct from New York, and I
venture to say cannot be duplicated in High Bridge
at the price at which I am knocking them down for.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, what am I offered for
this elegant family album, bound in plush, with
sliver-plated clasps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One dollar!&rdquo; called a rustic, standing close at
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dollar and a quarter!&rdquo; shouted a farmer near
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Podders, you ought to buy your
things of me,&rdquo; whispered the keeper of the general
store to the latter bidder. &ldquo;I trust you till the
money for crops comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So you do&mdash;and I pay you for the accommodation,
too,&rdquo; retorted the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can sell you an album for half the money he&rsquo;ll
charge you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; returned the farmer,
with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can. Come on over to the store and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to watch this sale first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time another person had offered a dollar
and a half for the album, and Matt was hard at
work trying to get a raise on this figure. But he
overheard the store-keeper&rsquo;s words, and his face
flushed with indignation. He stopped short, and
pointed directly at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please come forward a moment?&rdquo; he
asked, in a loud and clear tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; stammered the store-keeper,
taken by surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you if you would please come forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to ask you what right you have to come
in here and endeavor to take away my possible
customers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t taken any one away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were just trying to induce that man to
leave&mdash;told him you could sell him an album for
half the money I would charge.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What if I did&mdash;I can, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. If you could, folks would not flock
to such an auction-sale as this. They come here
because they can get things cheap&mdash;because they
are not overcharged, as they are in some places&mdash;because
they are told the truth about goods&mdash;because
they like to see a boy get along in spite of what
some mean man may do to take away his business&mdash;because
they&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Matt could go no further. His unexpected
speech brought forth a sudden applause that for the
moment drowned out every other sound.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>ACCUSED OF STEALING.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was plain to see that the store-keeper who had
thus thrust himself into the young auctioneer&rsquo;s business
was not in high favor with the residents of the
country town. To tell the truth, the man was not
liked by any one, and was only patronized by force
of circumstances or through long-standing habit.
He was a thoroughly mean man, and the fact that
his trade had been falling off steadily for several
years had not tended to sweeten his temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s one on Ike Marvelling, sure!&rdquo; laughed a
young man near the auction stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; Ike deserves it,&rdquo; returned a woman
beside him. &ldquo;He has no right to come in here and
abuse the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added another woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ike was always high-priced in everything,&rdquo; remarked
a jolly-faced farmer. &ldquo;If he had Pickle
Mountain to sell he would want double price for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>This bit of humor caused a laugh at the store-keeper&rsquo;s
expense, and put him in even worse humor
than had Matt&rsquo;s caustic remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, I didn&rsquo;t come in here to be abused!&rdquo;
he cried, addressing the young auctioneer in a bullying
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not asked in here at all, to my knowledge,&rdquo;
returned Matt. &ldquo;And you should have remained
away unless you intended to do the right
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, boy, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you think of me if I came over to
your store and told your customers that I could sell
them goods cheaper than you could? I rather
guess you would be for running me out&mdash;and mighty
lively, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he would!&rdquo; laughed several. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t
give you time to open your mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in here because I know all these auction
sales&mdash;they ain&rsquo;t really auctions at all&mdash;are frauds!&rdquo;
blustered Isaac Marvelling, finding it hard to say
anything in the face of so much opposition. &ldquo;These
chaps oughten to be allowed to sell a thing&mdash;they
swindle folks so, and if I had my way, the constable
would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop right there!&rdquo; interrupted Matt, his eyes
flashing. &ldquo;When you insinuate that I am a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
swindler, you go too far. You must take back those
words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I?&rdquo; sneered the store-keeper. &ldquo;Well, I
reckon not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then.&rdquo; Matt turned to several men
standing by the door. &ldquo;Will one of you gentlemen
kindly call in the constable or some other officer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Isaac
Marvelling in a lower tone, and much disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to have you put out as a disorderly
character, that&rsquo;s what I mean,&rdquo; returned Matt
firmly. &ldquo;I have paid my license, and so long as I
do business on the square I do not intend to allow
any one to bulldoze me or call me a swindler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried several men
in the crowd, and the woman who had first spoken
nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mighty big boy!&rdquo; sneered the store-keeper,
but all noticed that he retreated several
steps toward the open doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am big enough to defend myself,&rdquo; replied the
young auctioneer quickly. &ldquo;I want you to leave.
I am no more of a swindler than you are&mdash;perhaps
not as much. I am conducting this business on an
honest basis, and I will not stand by and let you or
any one else blacken my character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see&mdash;we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; muttered Isaac Marvelling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
and greatly enraged, but unable to say a word
in his own defense, and fearful that an officer might
appear, he withdrew.</p>
<p>This little incident served to make Matt many
friends. People always like to see persons stick up
for their rights, and in this particular case they were
pleased to see the mean store-keeper &ldquo;talked-down,&rdquo;
as he well deserved to be.</p>
<p>The album was again put up, and after considerable
talking was knocked down to Podders, the
very individual Isaac Marvelling had endeavored to
persuade away from the sale. Matt purposely let
Podders have the album quite cheaply, and as soon
as it was his Podders declared he would call at
Marvelling&rsquo;s store and see if it could be duplicated
at the price he had paid.</p>
<p>The young auctioneer knew this could not be
done, and he offered to buy the album back at
double the price should Podders succeed.</p>
<p>This pleased the farmer, and also many others,
and, as a consequence, Matt had a brisk run of luck
until closing-up time. The boy felt highly elated,
especially when, on counting up the cash, he found
he had taken in sixteen dollars, one third of which
was profit.</p>
<p>On the following morning another heavy rain
came up, and Matt found it of no advantage to open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
up for business. Shortly after dinner Andy came
back from New York, and to him Matt related all
that had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Matt, always stick up when you are
in the right, and you&rsquo;ll come out on top,&rdquo; said the
senior partner of the firm.</p>
<p>Andy had struck several decided bargains in
goods in the metropolis, and had invested every
dollar of available cash. He had had all of the
goods shipped to Phillipsburg, the next stopping
place, and said they would most likely find them at
the freight depot upon their arrival there.</p>
<p>During the afternoon it cleared up, and people
began to drift into the shop. Andy opened up the
sale, and by evening both of the partners were quite
busy. When he went to supper Matt saw Isaac
Marvelling, but the store-keeper only favored him
with a deep scowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he would like to chew my head off if
he dared,&rdquo; laughed the young auctioneer, as he
related the occurrence to Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, Matt. He feels sore, especially
as we are selling just such goods as he has displayed
in his window, and at about half the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t worry him after to-night,&rdquo;
smiled Matt, for the start for Phillipsburg was to be
made on the following morning.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>After closing up the sale that night, the wagon
was once more packed, so that they might be on
the way at an early hour. The stock on hand was
growing lighter, and they were glad to know that
more goods would await them upon their arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are doing famously,&rdquo; remarked Andy. &ldquo;If
we keep on we shall soon be rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to pay back Miss Bartlett what she
loaned me as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon she is in no hurry. You had better
keep some cash on hand in case of an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work of selling goods and packing the wagon
had tired Matt considerably, but his mind was too
much aroused to go to sleep at once, and so he
started out for a short walk before retiring.</p>
<p>He knew very little of the roads around the
village, but he was confident that he would not get
lost, especially as it was a bright starlight night.</p>
<p>He passed the shop where the sales had been
conducted, and then branched off on a road that but
a short distance away crossed a tiny brook.</p>
<p>At the brook he paused, and then, struck with a
sudden fancy, he left the bridge to go down and
bathe his hands and face in the cool, running water.</p>
<p>He had hardly leaped from the bridge to the
rocks below when a sudden noise beside him caused
him to start back. Almost at the same time a dark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
form passed under the bridge and was lost to view
in the bushes beyond. It looked somewhat like the
form of a man, but Matt was not sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was queer,&rdquo; thought the young auctioneer,
as he paused, in perplexity. &ldquo;Was that a man, or
only some animal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disturbed at the occurrence, Matt leaped up upon
the bridge again, without having touched the water.
He had hardly come up into the starlight when two
men came rushing toward him from the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried one of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the man!&rdquo; cried the other, and
Matt recognized Isaac Marvelling&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Catch
hold of him, Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment the two men stood beside
Matt. As he recognized the young auctioneer,
Isaac Marvelling set up a cry of surprise and
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I said them
auction fellows weren&rsquo;t no better than thieves!
This is the chap that broke in my store, Jackson, I
feel sure of it! I want him arrested, and you had
better handcuff him so that he can&rsquo;t get away from
you! No wonder they can sell cheap, when they
steal their goods!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>THE TELL-TALE CAP.</h3>
</div>
<p>For the moment Matt could do little more than
stare at the two men that confronted him. In a
dim way he realized that Isaac Marvelling&rsquo;s store
had been entered and robbed, and that the mean-minded
store-keeper fully believed that he was the
guilty party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a-holding him, Jackson?&rdquo; went on Isaac
Marvelling anxiously. &ldquo;Look out, or he may slip
away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him, right enough,&rdquo; returned Jackson,
one of the local constables. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have hard work
to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; demanded the young
auctioneer, aroused at last to the necessity of doing
something in his own behalf. &ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not just yet!&rdquo; returned Jackson.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jackson, don&rsquo;t let him slip you!&rdquo;
put in Marvelling eagerly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good talker,
but don&rsquo;t let that count with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me what I am wanted for?&rdquo; asked
Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For entering his store and stealing a lot of cutlery
and jewelry,&rdquo; returned the constable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-five dollars&rsquo; worth,&rdquo; added Marvelling.
&ldquo;And all new stock, too! Oh, you thought you
would get away with it mighty smart-like, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been near your store, and I know
nothing about the theft,&rdquo; was Matt&rsquo;s steady reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we saw you run away from the store and
come down here, didn&rsquo;t we, Jackson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly did,&rdquo; returned the constable, with
a grave shake of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw me?&rdquo; gasped Matt, starting back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Isaac Marvelling. &ldquo;I heard you
run out of the yard behind the store right after I
had called in Jackson to tell him about the robbery.
We both saw you jump the fence and skip off in
this direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well own up to what you have
done,&rdquo; added the constable. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do you any
good to deny it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the moment Matt did not reply to this. He
was thinking of what had occurred at the bridge
just before the two men had reached it. Could it
be possible that the dark object which had left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
place when he had arrived was the thief, rooted
out of what he had considered a safe hiding-place?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How near were you to me when you saw me
first?&rdquo; he asked of Marvelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were near enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see my face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind if we did or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I must say I didn&rsquo;t see your face,&rdquo; said the
constable, who, although a friend of the store-keeper,
was yet disposed to be fair and square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably saw a man, and he ran in this
direction,&rdquo; went on Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw you,&rdquo; said Marvelling doggedly.
&ldquo;March him back to the store, Jackson, and we&rsquo;ll
make him confess where he has placed the stolen
stuff. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have it with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to get back your goods you had
better listen to what I have to say,&rdquo; returned Matt,
trying to keep down his rising temper. &ldquo;I did not
enter your store, but perhaps I can put you on the
track of the party who did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! that&rsquo;s all talk!&rdquo; snarled Isaac Marvelling.
&ldquo;March him back, Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any harm to listen to his story,&rdquo;
said the constable meekly. &ldquo;I reckon you want to
get the goods back more than anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! of course!&rdquo; responded the store-keeper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
eagerly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to lose forty-five
dollars&rsquo; worth of stuff at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you didn&rsquo;t do the job, and that you
think you can put us on the right track?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can do something for you,&rdquo; returned
Matt.</p>
<p>And in a few brief words he told how he happened
to be at the bridge and what he had seen.
The constable listened with deep interest, but Isaac
Marvelling pooh-poohed the whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good one at telling &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said the store-keeper.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t place no credit in what he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t do any harm to investigate,&rdquo; replied
Jackson. &ldquo;You hold him, while I light my
lantern and take a look under the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may try to get away from me,&rdquo; said Marvelling,
as he surveyed Matt&rsquo;s tall and well-built
form with some trepidation. &ldquo;He would most likely
do anything to keep out of jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have more at stake than you have,&rdquo; cried the
young auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I consider my reputation worth considerably
more than a paltry forty-five dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you? Well, to me the reputation of a traveling
and swindling auctioneer isn&rsquo;t worth much!&rdquo;
grumbled Isaac Marvelling.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You may regret those words,&rdquo; was Matt&rsquo;s brief
reply; and for the time being he said no more.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Jackson had struck a match
and lit the somewhat smoky lantern he carried.</p>
<p>Seeing to it that Matt was safe in Marvelling&rsquo;s
custody, the constable sprang down from the bridge
to the rocks below. A second later he disappeared
under the bridge.</p>
<p>The two above heard him rummaging around in
the loose stones and among the brush for all of five
minutes. Both listened for some call from him, the
store-keeper all the while keeping a tight hold on
Matt&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have you found anything?&rdquo; cried the
store-keeper at last, unable longer to stand the suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; returned Jackson, and a second later he
appeared again, holding in his hand a carving-knife
and two spoons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found these under the bridge,&rdquo; he explained, as
he clambered up upon the structure again. &ldquo;They
are your goods, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they are my goods!&rdquo; cried Isaac Marvelling,
as he glanced at the articles. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
he went on disappointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I could find. There may be more
there or in the water.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This young rascal threw them there!&rdquo; cried the
store-keeper, shaking Matt&rsquo;s arm savagely. &ldquo;You
imp! tell me where the other things are at once, or
I&rsquo;ll skin you alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Marvelling; I want you to let
go of me and be reasonable,&rdquo; returned Matt, as
calmly as he could. &ldquo;I am not a thief. If I was,
would I tell the story I did, or send down your companion
to find those things? My story about that
object under the bridge is true, and, to my way of
thinking, it was the thief you saw jump the fence
and run in this direction. When I sprang down to
bathe my face and hands he got scared and ran out
on the other side of the bridge, and in his hurry he
must have dropped the things which have been
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His story may be true,&rdquo; put in Jackson mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice is to follow up the brook and see if
you cannot track the thief,&rdquo; went on the young
auctioneer. &ldquo;And do not lose any time in doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will become of you?&rdquo; sneered the
store-keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go with you, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;Come,
let us start without delay. If we can&rsquo;t find anybody
we can take the boy to the lock-up, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>Isaac Marvelling grumbled, but at last consented,
and soon all three were down under the bridge.
Here it was pitch-dark, and the feeble rays of the
lantern only lit up a circle that was less than three
yards in diameter.</p>
<p>In hopes of clearing himself, more than for the
purpose of aiding Isaac Marvelling in the recovery
of the goods, Matt set to work with a will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is another spoon,&rdquo; he said presently, and
he handed over a silver-plated affair, which at the
most was not worth fifteen cents, wholesale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are a couple of knives,&rdquo; added Jackson.
&ldquo;And here is a bit of paper some of the stuff must
have been wrapped in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; suddenly cried Matt, as he pointed
down into the water. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s cap, and it
looks as if it had just fallen in, for one side of the
peak is not yet wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that cap,&rdquo; returned the constable
quickly.</p>
<p>He snatched it from Matt&rsquo;s hand and turned with
it to the lantern. His examination lasted but a few
seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Marvelling, have you seen anything of old
Joe Yedley lately?&rdquo; he asked, turning to the store-keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yedley? Why, yes; he was in the store begging,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
only yesterday,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But what
has he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you give him anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him anything?&rdquo; cried Marvelling wrathfully.
&ldquo;Not a cent! I told him to clear out; that
I didn&rsquo;t want him to ever come in again. I have
no use for beggars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he go near the case with the cutlery and
jewelry in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I suppose he did. But what has he to
do with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Joe Yedley&rsquo;s cap; I would know it out
of a thousand. He is an old offender, and it is more
than likely that he is the thief!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>THE SHANTY IN THE WOODS.</h3>
</div>
<p>The reader may rest assured that Matt listened
with deep interest to the words of the constable.
He knew nothing of the man that had been mentioned
as the probable thief, but he was willing to
believe Jackson&rsquo;s supposition true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Joe Yedley&rsquo;s cap?&rdquo; returned Isaac Marvelling
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. You ought to know it well enough.
He has worn nothing else for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! how did it get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man must have dropped it in his haste to
get away when I came here,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;He left
in a big hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s most likely it,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;To
tell the truth, it looks just like a piece of Yedley&rsquo;s
work,&rdquo; he added slowly. &ldquo;He did it in order to
get square, as much as anything, I reckon. He
always resented being called a beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered Isaac Marvelling, not particularly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
pleased over the turn affairs seemed to be
taking. &ldquo;He may be guilty and he may not be. I
rather think you had better hold this young fellow
for awhile yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may hold me if you wish,&rdquo; put in the young
auctioneer. &ldquo;But if you want to get all of your
stuff back you had better follow up this Yedley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; returned the constable. &ldquo;I have
an idea I can find out where he has gone to. He
has several old hang-outs here, and most likely he&rsquo;ll
be at one or another of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are any of the places close at hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to put up at a shanty back here in the
woods,&rdquo; was the slow reply. &ldquo;It is possible he has
struck for that place&mdash;or else for Bill Voegler&rsquo;s
barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing we three make for the shanty without
delay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over, and finally Isaac
Marvelling, urged on solely by the desire to recover
his goods and not to clear Matt, consented to accompany
the others to the place the constable had
named.</p>
<p>It was a dark and lonely road the trio had to
travel. But Jackson knew the way well, and to
avoid suspicion, put out the light. He cautioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
them not to make any noise, and so, as silently as
Indians, they filed along, Jackson first and Marvelling
last, with the young auctioneer between them.</p>
<p>Ten minutes&rsquo; walking brought them to the edge
of a bit of woodland, surrounded on three sides by
corn-fields. Here Jackson called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shanty is not two hundred feet from here.
Keep quiet while I go on and investigate,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>The constable glided out of sight, and five minutes
of silent suspense followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t likely he&rsquo;ll find anything,&rdquo; grumbled
Isaac Marvelling. &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t anything but a wild
goose chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;He must go slow, or
he may&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young auctioneer broke off short, for at that
instant several loud exclamations reached their
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender, Yedley!&rdquo; they heard Jackson cry.
&ldquo;Surrender, in the name of the law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told ye to come here?&rdquo; yelled the voice of
an old man. &ldquo;Git out an&rsquo; leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrest you, Yedley, for stealing&mdash; Hullo!
he&rsquo;s gone! Stop him! stop him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the banging of a shanty door, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
then a crashing in the bushes. Footsteps came
close to where Matt and Marvelling stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming this way!&rdquo; cried the young auctioneer.
&ldquo;Let us stop him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stop him!&rdquo; stammered the store-keeper.
&ldquo;He is&mdash;is a very ugly man to deal with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the old fellow in question appeared in
sight, the store-keeper dropped down behind the
rail fence, leaving Matt to face Joe Yedley alone.</p>
<p>This the young <a name='TC_2'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'auctioneeer'">auctioneer</ins> did without hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop where you are!&rdquo; he cried out, and as
Yedley attempted to leap the fence, he caught the
fellow by the leg and dragged him to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; howled the man savagely.
&ldquo;Let go, boy, or it will be the worse for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you attempt to rise, or I&rsquo;ll knock you
down,&rdquo; was Matt&rsquo;s undaunted reply. &ldquo;Just you
remain where you are until Mr. Jackson gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Yedley would not remain still, and as a consequence,
a fierce struggle ensued. Matt called to
Isaac Marvelling to come to his assistance, but the
store-keeper was too afraid to do so, and only
screamed for Jackson to come and secure the thief.</p>
<p>Yedley, although well along in years, was very
strong and active, and Matt gradually found himself
being overpowered. But he held on until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Jackson arrived, and then the man was quickly
subdued by the sight of the constable&rsquo;s pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Yedley, you had better tell us what you
have done with the stolen goods,&rdquo; said Jackson,
after he and the others had somewhat regained their
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! yes! hand over my goods!&rdquo; put in Isaac
Marvelling eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t got no goods&mdash;didn&rsquo;t steal nuthin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
growled the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know better,&rdquo; said Jackson. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll search
the shanty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done, and in one corner, under some
loose flooring, was found a large bundle done up in
several newspapers. When this was opened there
came to light many knives, forks and spoons, as well
as a quantity of cheap jewelry, such as watch chains,
rings and trinkets. The entire collection was not
worth over fifteen dollars, although Isaac Marvelling
stuck to it that the articles had cost him forty-five
dollars cash.</p>
<p>After the store-keeper had made certain that all
of his goods, with the exception of several cheap
spoons, which must have slipped out of the bundle
on the way, were safe, all hands made their way
back to the village. Yedley begged to be allowed
to go, but the constable was firm, and the man was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
eventually locked up, and later on sent to jail for
one year.</p>
<p>Isaac Marvelling was too mean a man to recognize
the service Matt had done him, or to apologize for
the false charges he had made against the young
auctioneer. As soon as he could he got out of
Matt&rsquo;s way, and that was about the last the boy
saw of him.</p>
<p>But Jackson, the constable, did not hesitate to tell
the whole story, and, as a consequence, the people
of the village thought less of the mean store-keeper
than ever. His trade dropped down daily, until he
was at last forced to give up his store and go back
to the farm from which he had originally come.</p>
<p>On the following morning Matt and his partner
set off bright and early for Phillipsburg. Andy had
heard the particulars of Matt&rsquo;s adventures, and he
sincerely trusted that neither would have anything
further to do with thieves, little dreaming of what
fate had in store for them in the near future.</p>
<p>They had done very well in High Bridge, and so
took their time to reach the pretty manufacturing
town which lies on the east bank of the Delaware.
The road was a good one, and on the way they
stopped at a farmhouse, where Andy treated the
firm, as he termed it, to apple pie and fresh milk.
He was going to pay for these articles in cash, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
the farmer&rsquo;s wife wished a hat-pin, and gladly took
one out of their stock instead.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Phillipsburg they found
that their new goods from New York had not yet
arrived, but were told that the cases would probably
come in on the afternoon freight. After this
they started to find a vacant store. Strange to say,
there was none to be had which would suit their
purpose. There were several large places vacant,
but all of them were on side streets, and these they
declined to hire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to sell direct from the wagon,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll do just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found a good corner, and after paying a
license fee and getting a square meal, opened up for
business. Hardly anything was done during the
afternoon, but toward evening trade picked up, and
when they finally dismissed the crowd they found
they had taken in seventeen dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s pretty good, considering that we are
out of many of our best sellers,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;We must go around to the freight house
the first thing in the morning and stock up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see by the posters that there is to be a big firemen&rsquo;s
parade in Easton day after to-morrow,&rdquo; said
Matt. &ldquo;Would it not be a good idea to locate there
just before it comes off?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent. Day after to-morrow, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the posters are everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then instead of remaining here we had better
cross the river as soon as we have our cases of
goods. If we can only get a store in a good location
we may do better than we did on circus day in those
other places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Andy, for I saw by the bills that
the railroads are going to run special excursions on
account of the big parade, so there will be many
strangers with money in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the freight depot was open the next
morning the two drove to the place, and Andy
entered the office and called for the cases, three in
number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name?&rdquo; asked the agent in charge.</p>
<p>Andy told him, and an examination of all the
freight which had come in was made, and then the
two made the dismaying discovery that no goods
for them had arrived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING IS MISSING.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The goods haven&rsquo;t come in!&rdquo; cried Matt.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done now? We can&rsquo;t open up without
them, and we can&rsquo;t afford to miss the chance of
taking a good round sum on parade day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telegraph to New York and find out what
the trouble is,&rdquo; returned Andy, and he started for
the <a name='TC_3'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'telergaph'">telegraph</ins> office without delay.</p>
<p>The message was sent to the metropolis within
quarter of an hour, reaching its destination before
any of the down-town wholesale houses were open
for business. At eleven o&rsquo;clock a reply came back
that the cases had been duly sent, and that the
delay would be traced up, if possible, at the freight
depot there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This leaves us in a pickle for to-day,&rdquo; said Andy,
as he handed the message over to Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t be so bad if only we get our
goods by to-morrow morning, Andy. Let us go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
over to Easton, anyway, and look for a store, and if
we can find one, take the risk of hiring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they crossed the river and began a search,
leaving the horse and wagon tied up at the freight
depot in Phillipsburg in the meantime.</p>
<p>They found that the firemen&rsquo;s parade was really
to be very large, and already the store-keepers were
decorating in its honor. On the streets numerous
fakirs were about, offering badges, medals, song-sheets,
souvenirs, and other wares for sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this street, and you take that,&rdquo; said
Andy, as they came to a corner. &ldquo;Go around the
block, and then take the next block. In that way
we may find a store quicker. There is no use for
both of us to go over the same ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after appointing a meeting-place, the two
separated, and Matt hurried along the street Andy
had designated to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, gents, the most wonderful corn
and bunion salve in the market!&rdquo; he presently
heard a voice crying out. &ldquo;Made first expressly
for the Emperor of Germany, and now sold in
America for the first time. Warranted to cure the
worst corn ever known, and sold for the small sum
of ten cents! They go like hot-cakes, the boxes do,
for they all know how good the salve is! Thank
you, sir; who&rsquo;ll have the next?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>Matt stopped short, as something in the voice of
the street merchant attracted his attention. He
looked at the man and saw that it was Paul Barberry,
the fellow who had wished to be taken in as
a partner in Newark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a box of that ere salve,&rdquo; Matt heard an
old man say, and saw the traveling corn doctor hand
over a package of his preparation.</p>
<p>The purchaser of the package handed over a
quarter of a dollar in silver. Barberry stuck the
money in his pocket, and without attempting to
give back any change, thrust two more packages of
his corn salve into the old man&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; stammered the old fellow.
&ldquo;Where is my change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, three for a quarter, sir,&rdquo; returned
Paul Barberry briskly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll have the
next? Don&rsquo;t all crowd up at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want three,&rdquo; said the old man
timidly. &ldquo;I want my change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find you need three, find &rsquo;em very valuable,
sir! That&rsquo;s right, come right up and buy,
buy, buy! It&rsquo;s the greatest on the face of the
globe!&rdquo; bawled Barberry, turning away and addressing
another crowd on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; muttered the old man,
and much put out, but too timid to stand up for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
rights and demand the return of his money, he
placed the packages in his coat-tail pocket, and
walked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I call a rather high-handed
proceeding,&rdquo; thought Matt. &ldquo;No wonder some folks
consider street merchants and traveling auctioneers
little better than thieves, when some of them act in
that fashion. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll prosper, though,
in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to continue on his way, when Paul
Barberry caught sight of him and came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, my young friend!&rdquo; he called out
pleasantly. &ldquo;What brings you to Easton&mdash;the big
parade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt did not like this manner of being addressed.
He considered the corn salve doctor altogether too
familiar, so he replied rather coldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly. We merely struck Easton in
the course of our travels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you and your companion are still on
the road with your wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Barberry seemed to grow interested at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough! And how is business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; returned Matt, and not without
pardonable pride.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are not ready to take me in as a
partner yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite; my friend and I can run the business
very well without outside help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you might make more money with me in
the firm,&rdquo; went on Paul Barberry persistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t room for a third person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you stopping now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a place yet. My partner and I have
just started to look for an empty store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you are going to stay several days or
a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do pretty well in Phillipsburg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did very well&mdash;until we began to run out of
goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do anything in Phillipsburg,&rdquo;
grumbled Paul Barberry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a one-horse
place, anyway. So you ran out of goods there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ran out of some goods&mdash;our best sellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you send for more goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have sent, and we are expecting the cases
at any moment at the Phillipsburg freight depot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your horse and wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tied up at the depot over there,&rdquo; and to avoid
being questioned further, Matt began to move off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can get a good store for you,&rdquo; went on
Barberry, catching him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I would prefer to do my own
hunting,&rdquo; returned the young auctioneer, still more
coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want anything to do with me, eh?&rdquo; retorted
the corn salve vender angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to take your valuable time in
transacting my business,&rdquo; returned Matt, and off he
hurried, before Barberry could offer any reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and his partner are mighty independent
chaps,&rdquo; grumbled the pretended doctor, as he gazed
after Matt, with a scowl on his face. &ldquo;I suppose
he thinks himself above me because he has a horse
and wagon. Well, maybe he won&rsquo;t be any better
off than I am some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, in far from a good humor, Paul Barberry
resumed the sale of his so-styled wonderful corn
cure, a preparation, by the way, which was of no
value as a remedial agent.</p>
<p>Matt walked along for several blocks without
running across any empty stores that would be
suitable for holding sales. Most of the places were
too small, and others were in out-of-the-way corners,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
to which it would be next to impossible to attract a
crowd.</p>
<p>At the appointed time he walked to the spot
where he was to meet Andy. His partner was
waiting for him, a smile resting on his pleasant
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any luck, Matt?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve struck something that I imagine will just
suit us. Come on and look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two hurried to the place Andy had in mind.
It was, indeed, a good store, and just in the right
spot, and ten minutes later they were on the way to
hunt up the landlord and rent the place.</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to find the person for
whom they were seeking, and it was well along in
the afternoon before the man who owned the building
was found. He agreed to let them have the
store for four days for ten dollars, and the bargain
was closed on the spot.</p>
<p>Then they returned to the store and cleaned
it up as best they could, and at a little after five
o&rsquo;clock locked up and started back to Phillipsburg
to ascertain if their cases of goods had yet arrived.</p>
<p>The walk across the bridge did not take long, and
the freight depot was close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where is the horse and wagon?&rdquo; cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
Matt, as he discovered that the turn-out was missing
from the place where Billy had been fastened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I would like to know,&rdquo; returned
Andy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a thing of it anywhere,
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked around, up one street and down
another, but neither Billy nor the gayly-painted
wagon came into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask the freight agent about it,&rdquo; said Matt,
and he hurried into the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your horse and wagon?&rdquo; repeated the agent, in
reply to his question. &ldquo;Why, I guess your man
drove off with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our man?&rdquo; gasped the young auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the one you sent around here to get those
cases of goods you were expecting. He took the

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>ALONG THE RIVER.</h3>
</div>
<p>Matt could do nothing but stare at the freight
agent. A man had come there and driven off with
the horse and wagon and taken the cases of goods
with him. It seemed too bold-faced to be true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our man?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;We have no man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send the man here?&rdquo; demanded the
agent, as he stopped short in his work of checking
off packages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly did not,&rdquo; returned the young auctioneer.
&ldquo;Andy!&rdquo; he called out, as he stepped back
toward the open door, and a moment later Andy
Dilks hurried into the depot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says a man came here, got the cases of goods,
and drove off with Billy,&rdquo; cried Matt breathlessly.
&ldquo;You did not send any one here, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; returned Andy promptly.
&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than two hours ago,&rdquo; replied the freight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
agent, and he was now all attention. &ldquo;Do you
mean to say the fellow was a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was!&rdquo; cried Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he could be anything else,&rdquo;
added Andy. &ldquo;Did he pretend to have an order
for the cases?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had a written order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bill of lading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, he didn&rsquo;t have that,&rdquo; was the slow reply.
&ldquo;But I thought it was all right. He looked like an
honest chap. You had better notify the police at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;What sort of a looking
fellow was he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As best he could the freight agent gave a description
of the man who had driven off with the goods
and the turn-out. Matt and Andy both listened
attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the boots, I&rsquo;ll bet it was that Paul Barberry!&rdquo;
almost shouted the young auctioneer, ere the agent
had ceased talking. &ldquo;This is his way of getting
even with us for not taking him into partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;Did
you say anything to him about the wagon being
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo; And Matt briefly narrated the conversation
he had had with the corn doctor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>Then the agent was questioned further, and it
was not long before all three were convinced that
the pretended doctor was the guilty party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had known he wasn&rsquo;t square I would not
have let him have the cases of goods, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo;
said the agent meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt that,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;But
the loss of the horse and wagon is more than we
can stand as it is. We will have to hold the railroad
responsible for the three cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go after the thief?&rdquo; suggested the
agent, considerably worried, for he well knew that
if the stolen cases were not recovered the loss would
come out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a horse and wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I can get it in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What direction did the thief take, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The freight agent thought for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my opinion that he either went over to
Easton or else up the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not likely that he went across the bridge,&rdquo;
said Matt. &ldquo;If it was this Paul Barberry he would
be afraid to take that direction, fearing to meet me
and my partner on our way here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; put in Andy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then he went up the river. There is quite a
good road for a number of miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, supposing you get your horse and wagon,&rdquo;
said Matt impatiently. &ldquo;It will not do to waste
time here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of the police?&rdquo; questioned Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can notify them when we come back&mdash;that
is, if we are unsuccessful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; hurry up that wagon, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The freight agent at once disappeared around the
corner of the building. He was gone nearly five
minutes. When he returned he was leading a fine
black horse, attached to a light road wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought you Flip, my fast trotter,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;He ought to be able to overtake any bit of horseflesh
in these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we want a fast horse,&rdquo; replied Matt, as he
sprang into the wagon without delay. He was
quickly followed by Andy and the freight agent,
and off they went at a spanking gait down the
smooth road.</p>
<p>It was a fine day, cool and clear, and under any
other circumstances both Matt and Andy would
have enjoyed the drive. But just now they were
filled with fears. Supposing they were unable to
recover their turn-out and goods what then?</p>
<p>The partners looked at each other, and that look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
meant but one thing. They must recover their
property. Such a thing as failure was not to be
countenanced.</p>
<p>At length Phillipsburg was left far behind, and
they entered a somewhat hilly farming section.
Presently they came to a farmhouse standing close
to the road. There was an old countryman standing
by the gate, smoking a pipe leisurely, and Matt
directed the freight agent to draw rein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said the young auctioneer
politely. &ldquo;I wish to ask you for a bit of information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, son, what is it?&rdquo; returned the old countryman,
removing his pipe from his mouth and gazing
at all three curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did an auction wagon pass this way a short
while ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An auction wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, a covered wagon, with the sign,
&lsquo;Eureka Auction Co.,&rsquo; painted on the sides. It had
a single white horse, with brown spots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face lit up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I saw that wagon,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;We are very glad to
hear it. Which way did it go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right up that way,&rdquo; and the countryman waved
his hand to the northwest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Along the river still,&rdquo; said the freight agent.
&ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to drive on when Matt stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice who was driving the wagon?&rdquo;
he called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a tall man kind of shabbily dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be Barberry,&rdquo; muttered the young
auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; questioned the countryman
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The turn-out has been stolen, that&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo;
replied the boy, and off they sped again, leaving the
old countryman staring after them in open-mouthed
wonder.</p>
<p>They turned from the main road, which about
half a mile back had led away from the Delaware,
and took the side road the old man had indicated.
It was an uneven wagon track, and they went
bumping over rocks and stumps of trees in a most
alarming fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have gone far in this direction,&rdquo;
muttered the freight agent ruefully. &ldquo;Why, it is
enough to break the springs of any wagon ever
made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea is that he had an object in coming
down here,&rdquo; responded Andy thoughtfully. &ldquo;Is
there any sort of bridge in the neighborhood?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>The agent shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a place where the river might be forded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. The heavy rains have swollen the
stream, as you can see. In real dry weather he
might find a place to ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s certain that if he came this way to
merely get out of our reach he chose an awful way
of doing it,&rdquo; remarked Matt, as a sudden lurch of
the wagon sent him bouncing up into the air.
&ldquo;This is the worst riding I&rsquo;ve struck yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than when Billy ran away?&rdquo; questioned
Andy, with a sudden gleam of humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hardly that,&rdquo; admitted the young auctioneer.
&ldquo;But that wasn&rsquo;t riding at all. That was a
slap-bang, go-as-you-please trip, which didn&rsquo;t&mdash;hullo!
look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He motioned to the freight agent to draw rein
and pointed to a deep track in a soft bit of ground
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the track of our wagon sure enough!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy. &ldquo;I could tell it out of a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So could I, Andy. Follow that, please,&rdquo; went
on Matt, to the agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer you didn&rsquo;t see that track before,&rdquo; said
the driver slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason is because it comes from the rocks.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
Barberry thought it best to keep on the rocks, I
suppose. Maybe he thought he would get stuck in
the mud with the cases if he got on soft ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth of it, you can depend on it,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;Hurry up and follow that track to
the end, and we&rsquo;ll soon have our wagon and goods
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on they went, over soft patches of ground,
through low bushes, and around rocks and fallen
trees. Sometimes they were close to the water&rsquo;s
edge, and again they traveled almost out of sight of
the clear-flowing stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go much further in this direction,&rdquo;
said the freight agent, when all of a mile of ground
had been covered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a big wall of rock just ahead. We will
have to pull away from the river now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; shouted Matt. &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he pointed to where the wagon tracks led
directly down into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet all I am worth that he crossed the stream
here,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Do you not see how shallow
it is? He went over to that island, and from there
directly to the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>A BITTER MISTAKE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Both Andy and the freight agent saw at once that
Matt was right, and the jaw of the driver of the
wagon dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I was certain he couldn&rsquo;t cross right
after such heavy rains,&rdquo; he said moodily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see he has crossed,&rdquo; went on the young
auctioneer. &ldquo;I will tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do&mdash;wade
across and see if I can&rsquo;t strike the tracks on
the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get pretty wet, especially if you slip into
a deep hole,&rdquo; returned Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take off part of my clothing,&rdquo; returned Matt,
and he did so without delay.</p>
<p>The water was colder than he had anticipated,
and he shivered slightly as he waded in deeper and
deeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you swim, should you slip?&rdquo; called out
Andy anxiously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can swim,&rdquo; returned Matt, &ldquo;but I hope
that won&rsquo;t be necessary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moving along cautiously where the rocks stuck
up the highest, the young auctioneer worked his
way slowly over to the island he had previously
pointed out. It was painful work, for he had taken
off his shoes, and now he found the bottom in many
places cut his feet. But at last the island was
reached, and he walked out upon the dry ground.</p>
<p>It did not take Matt long to discover the wagon
tracks for which he was searching. They were
close at hand, and led almost in a straight line
across the little patch, which was not over two
hundred feet in width.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; he shouted back to the others.
&ldquo;He went right across just as I supposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Now what is to be done?&rdquo; questioned
the agent, with a perplexed look upon his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must cross and follow him,&rdquo; replied Andy
determinedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to take the horse and wagon
across?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? The thief took that heavily loaded
wagon over. I guess this light affair will go over
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>The agent was doubtful about this, and rubbed
his chin reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might drive on till I got to a bridge, or turn
back to one,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would take too long,&rdquo; returned Matt&rsquo;s
partner impatiently. &ldquo;We must &lsquo;strike while the
iron is hot,&rsquo; as the saying is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; shouted Matt from the island.
&ldquo;Come straight over and you will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can make the venture, but I am a bit
shaky over it,&rdquo; said the freight agent, and with a
face full of the concern he felt for his turn-out he
headed his trotter toward the water.</p>
<p>At first the horse was inclined to shy to one side.
He pranced up and down a bit and dug into the
sand and loose stones with his hoofs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see he don&rsquo;t want to go,&rdquo; said the
driver. &ldquo;I really think we had better find a
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense! give me the reins!&rdquo; returned
Andy sharply, seeing that the fellow was altogether
too easily frightened. &ldquo;I will take him
over safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure!&rdquo; cried the agent in alarm.
&ldquo;He will break at the least little thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Andy would not listen to him further. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
took the reins, and holding them firmly, tapped the
trotter with the whip.</p>
<p>The horse made a rush into the water, and in less
than ten seconds the wagon was in up to the axles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be drowned! We will be drowned!&rdquo;
cried the agent in sudden terror. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t swim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be drowned. Just you hold on and
keep quiet,&rdquo; returned Andy shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but we are going deeper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much deeper. I can still see the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing we should slip&mdash;or Flip should slip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we had an earthquake,&rdquo; added Andy, utterly
disgusted with the freight agent&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you want to get back those cases, or do you prefer
to pay for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last remark effectually silenced the man.
He clung to the seat looking badly scared, but he
offered no more suggestions.</p>
<p>With due caution, but as rapidly as possible, Andy
drove the horse over the rocks, carefully avoiding
such spots as he thought might be extra deep or
slippery. Matt, on the island, shouted several
directions to him; and thus the journey was safely
accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good so far!&rdquo; cried the young auctioneer, when
the horse was once more on dry ground. &ldquo;That
was easy enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Easier than I thought it would be!&rdquo; exclaimed
the freight agent, with a deep breath of relief. &ldquo;I
wish we were over all the way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second trip will be easier than the first
was,&rdquo; remarked Andy. &ldquo;It is much more shallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wade ahead and make sure of the way,&rdquo;
put in Matt, and without loss of time he started
out.</p>
<p>It was not so deep toward the Pennsylvania
shore, but the current appeared to run swifter, and
the boy had all he could do when up to his thighs
to keep his feet. But the horse and wagon came
along all right, and inside of ten minutes they were
high and dry upon the opposite bank.</p>
<p>Here it did not take long to rediscover the tracks
made by the auction turn-out, and as soon as Matt
could don what clothing he had taken off, they
started to follow it up once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why he crossed the river in that
fashion,&rdquo; grumbled the freight agent, as he tapped
his horse with the whip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;He did it to throw
us off the track. He had no time to get rid of the
signs on the wagon, and he knew we would learn,
sooner or later, in what direction he had gone.
But he thought we would not find out how he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
crossed and would think that he had kept along on
the eastern bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on they went, over the rocky roads, now
through a sharp cut between the mountains, and
then again around a curve overlooking some tiny
stream far below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beautiful place,&rdquo; said Matt, as his eyes rested
on a particularly beautiful bit of picturesque scenery.
&ldquo;How can people stick in the stuffy city when there
is so much like this going to waste, so to speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a conundrum,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;But I
have heard it said that many city-born folks would
rather die between brick walls than live amid green
fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at those rocks and trees, and listen to
those birds sing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is truly grand, that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; returned Andy.
&ldquo;Do you know, if I was wealthy, I believe I would
like nothing better than to spend all of my summer
in among the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would just suit me,&rdquo; returned Matt
enthusiastically, and then he suddenly sobered down.
&ldquo;But we are not rich, Andy, and unless we get back
our turn-out we&rsquo;ll be as poor as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll have to catch that thief,&rdquo; put in the
freight agent. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be many miles ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is it&rsquo;s growing dark, and we can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
hardly see the wagon tracks any more,&rdquo; said the
young auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It grows dark early in among the mountains,&rdquo;
remarked Andy. &ldquo;If the land was level, it would
be light enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they went, passing through several little hamlets.
At each of these places they inquired about
the auction wagon, and were told that it had passed
through, the man driving at almost top speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to get away as far as he can before
he puts up for the night,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I do not
believe we will catch him until we reach the place
at which he is stopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trotter is not used to this sort of thing,&rdquo;
said the freight agent. &ldquo;He is beginning to play
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the next town we reach we can hire a horse,&rdquo;
said Matt. &ldquo;And you can go back if you wish.
There is no telling how long this chase may last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be back attending to business,&rdquo; was
the agent&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;My clerk can hardly take my
place. Would you two be willing to go on alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; returned Andy.</p>
<p>The next place, a village of perhaps twenty or
thirty houses and half a dozen stores, was soon
reached. There was a small tavern, and they drove
up to this. Alighting, Matt ran inside and questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
the half a score of loungers concerning the
auction wagon.</p>
<p>Every man in the place shook his head. The
wagon had not been seen in the village. Nearly all
of the men had just come in from work, and every
one said that had the wagon been on the main road
at all he would have seen it.</p>
<p>Matt listened with a sinking heart, and as Andy
came in he grasped his <a name='TC_4'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'parter'">partner</ins> by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have made a mistake,&rdquo; he said faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mistake, Matt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The wagon did not come here at all. We
are on the wrong track!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXVI_SOMETHING_OF_A_SURPRISE' id='CHAPTER_XXVI_SOMETHING_OF_A_SURPRISE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Andy was certainly as much dismayed as Matt at
the discovery which had been made. Just at the
time when they supposed that they were drawing
closer to the object of their chase, they found that
they were most likely further away than ever.
The older member of the firm gave another groan,
and this was supplemented by another from the
freight agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he couldn&rsquo;t cross that river,&rdquo; growled
the latter. &ldquo;Now, just see what a wild goose chase
you have led us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he crossed the river, there is no doubt of
that!&rdquo; returned Matt quickly. &ldquo;But where we got
off the track was somewhere among the mountains.
We dropped the right track and took something
that resembled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must be the truth of the matter,&rdquo; put
in Andy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it all about, anyway?&rdquo; questioned the
tavern-keeper curiously.</p>
<p>In a few brief words Andy explained matters,
while not only the tavern-keeper, but also the others
in the place, listened with deep interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any reward offered for catching the rascal?&rdquo;
questioned one of the men present, a brawny individual&mdash;evidently
a mountaineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Matt quickly. &ldquo;How much
shall we offer, Andy?&rdquo; he asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars would not be too much,&rdquo;
returned his partner. &ldquo;It is quite a sum to us, I
know, but I guess we would rather have our turn-out
back a dozen times over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will give twenty-five dollars in cash for the
return of our horse, wagon and goods,&rdquo; said Matt,
in a voice loud enough for all to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars in cash!&rdquo; repeated several,
and it was plain to see that this offer was regarded
as quite liberal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a looking turn-out is it?&rdquo; was
next asked.</p>
<p>Matt described Billy and the wagon. All listened
attentively, and when he had finished the mountaineer
who had first spoken tapped him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out with ye and hunt him up, stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So will I!&rdquo; cried another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I!&rdquo; added a third, and soon six men stood
ready to continue the search with Andy and Matt.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the freight agent decided to drive
back home, taking a much better road, which led
down to Easton. He did not lose any time in
starting, and, if the truth must be told, both Andy
and Matt were glad to be rid of him.</p>
<p>After he had gone the auctioneers procured
another horse and wagon from the tavern-keeper
and also a couple of lanterns. The mountaineer had
a mule upon which he rode, and the other men
went along on foot.</p>
<p>They traveled the road by which the young
auctioneers had come. The village was situated in a
small open spot, and now, when they once more
found themselves between the mountains, they were
enveloped in a darkness which the rays of the lanterns
scarcely dispersed.</p>
<p>They traveled along as rapidly as possible, and
inside of half an hour came to a fork in the road
which Matt had had in mind since the discovery of
their mistake had been made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will examine the ground here,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It is more than likely he branched off here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was soon hard at work, and all of the others
with him. The wagon track they had followed was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
very plainly to be seen, and now Matt saw, at a
spot which was covered with loose stones, where
the thief had branched off with his stolen outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the road he took,&rdquo; he announced to the
others. &ldquo;Had we followed him from here in the
first place we would most likely have caught up to
him by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that &rsquo;ere track the right one?&rdquo; questioned
the mountaineer eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m off fer the reward!&rdquo; shouted the
brawny fellow. &ldquo;Git up, Bones!&rdquo; and he slapped
the mule with the flat of his hand, and was off without
another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramson will get it, sure,&rdquo; grumbled one of the
other men. &ldquo;No use for us to go any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he turned on his heel and started back for
the village, followed by most of the others, leaving
a single man to race after the mountaineer on foot.</p>
<p>Matt and Andy were not slow to urge their fresh
horse forward. But the way was now even darker
than before and also rougher, and it was with difficulty
that the wagon moved along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he went very far on this road,&rdquo;
said Matt, bringing the horse to a halt. &ldquo;I am going
to follow that track on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang down from the seat, and with the light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
close to the ground, moved along in front of the
horse. It was well that he did so, for hardly had
he advanced a hundred feet than he uttered a cry
and came to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; questioned Andy, peering forward
through the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned off here and went into the brush on
the left. Don&rsquo;t you see the tracks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is no road through the brush. He
would lose his way and get caught among the rocks
further back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea that he drove away in here to
hide the wagon,&rdquo; suddenly cried Matt. &ldquo;He could
very well do that, you know, and then ride off on
horseback to some place and put up for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the boots, I believe you are right!&rdquo; returned
Andy. &ldquo;Why, of course that is just what he has
done! How stupid of us not to think of that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the wagon is still O. K.,&rdquo; went on Matt.
&ldquo;It would be hard work to get a spring fixed in this
out-of-the-way place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must find the wagon first. Supposing
we tie up and go ahead on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon side by side, making their way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
through the brush and around the rocks as rapidly as
they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go forward as silently as possible!&rdquo; suddenly
whispered the boy. &ldquo;Barberry may still be
around, and if that is so we want to surprise him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea! What a pity we can&rsquo;t put
out the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do without it. The track is growing
fainter. We are coming to almost solid rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on they pushed, until Andy calculated
that they had covered a distance of five hundred
feet from the main road. Then they found themselves
on the verge of a deep ravine, with a high
wall of rock to the left of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! supposing he drove over that!&rdquo; shuddered
Andy, as he pointed into the blackness of the
hollow. &ldquo;That must be a hundred feet or more
deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went to the right, Andy&mdash;the only way he
could go. Have you any matches with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What do you want of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to put out the light, for I fancy the
wagon is not far off, and the thief may be around
also. If we wish we can light up again later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt did as he had intimated, and the two found
themselves in a darkness that was simply intense to
the last degree. They could not see their hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
before their faces, and had to literally feel their way
along.</p>
<p>Matt went first, with his partner holding on to
the hem of his jacket. They had progressed but a
dozen feet when, on rounding a high rock, the young
auctioneer stopped once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was right,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The wagon is
directly ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the lantern, which is standing on the
seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the thief must still be around,&rdquo; returned
Andy excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so, but I don&rsquo;t see any one. Come on,
but don&rsquo;t make any noise, or he may run away, and
I think he ought to be captured and locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly he ought to be placed under arrest.
I am ready. Won&rsquo;t he be surprised when he sees
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again they moved forward toward where
the auction wagon stood beneath the shelter of a
large tree. Matt noted that Billy had been unharnessed
and was tied to the rear, where he was
engaged in making a meal of some feed which had
been given him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barberry is making himself at home evidently,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
murmured the young auctioneer to himself. &ldquo;That
fellow certainly has nerve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up!&rdquo; suddenly cried Andy, catching the
boy by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there, to your right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt did as directed, and saw a sight which both
amazed and alarmed him. There, by a little fire
built to keep them comfortable in the night air, sat
two burly men, drinking and smoking. Neither of
the individuals was Paul Barberry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>TIMELY ASSISTANCE.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows must be the thieves,&rdquo; whispered
Andy, as he pointed to the pair beneath the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;If
so, we have made a big mistake. Neither of them
is Paul Barberry, and I was almost certain he was
the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I, Matt. But never mind that now.
What worries me is the fact that there are two of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they both look like strong fellows,&rdquo;
returned the young auctioneer, as he surveyed the
pair. &ldquo;If they get ugly when we claim the turn-out
we may have a lively time with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we are in the right, and we must stick up
for our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; cried Matt determinedly.
&ldquo;But I say, wouldn&rsquo;t it be best if we each
got a stout stick? They may show fight if they
fancy we are beyond outside aid.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can bluff them into believing that
we have the village authorities at our back,&rdquo; suggested
Andy. &ldquo;I would rather frighten them off
than run the risk of coming off second best in a set-to
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! what are you fellows doing here?&rdquo; suddenly
demanded a voice just behind Andy. &ldquo;Do you
belong&mdash;what, you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the speaker, none other than Paul Barberry,
stepped back in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble there, Barberry?&rdquo; cried one
of the men by the fire, and both sprang up in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here are the&mdash;the&mdash;a couple of young
fellows,&rdquo; stammered the corn salve doctor. He was
so surprised he could hardly speak. &ldquo;How did you
get here?&rdquo; he asked slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;I imagine
you know what we are here for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; returned Andy sarcastically. &ldquo;Well,
then, let me tell you that we came for our horse
and wagon and stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything of yours,&rdquo; returned Paul
Barberry, gradually recovering from his surprise. In
making a circle around the improvised camp he had
stumbled upon them quite unexpectedly. &ldquo;You
talk as if I was a thief.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you run off with that horse and wagon?&rdquo;
demanded Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run off with it? No, why should I? The outfit
belongs to me. Isn&rsquo;t that so, boys?&rdquo; and the
corn salve doctor turned to his burly companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it does!&rdquo; returned the men.</p>
<p>A thunderbolt from the sky at that moment would
not have taken Andy and Matt more by surprise
than did this statement. Paul Barberry&rsquo;s assurance
actually staggered them, and neither could
speak for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That outfit belongs to you?&rdquo; cried Matt at
length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the biggest falsehood I ever heard in my
life!&rdquo; burst out Andy. &ldquo;You know very well that
everything there belongs to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know no such thing,&rdquo; returned Barberry coldly.
&ldquo;I bought the outfit from you, and you know it.
These gentlemen know it also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he waved his hand toward his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, we know all about it,&rdquo; said one of
the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we saw the money paid over,&rdquo; added the
second fellow.</p>
<p>Matt and Andy looked at each other. Each knew
very well that the other had never made any bargain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
for the sale of the turn-out and stock. The
whole scheme was one of the corn doctor to get
possession of their belongings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Barberry, there is no use for you to
talk in this fashion,&rdquo; went on Matt, as calmly as he
could, although he was worked up to the top notch
of excitement. &ldquo;You know very well that you are
asserting that which is not true. The outfit belongs
to us, and you haven&rsquo;t the shadow of an
interest in it. You stole it from the Phillipsburg
freight depot, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; blustered the corn salve doctor.
&ldquo;How dare you call me a thief, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what you are, and nothing less. If
you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, fellows?&rdquo; interrupted Barberry,
turning to the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to keep a civil tongue in your head,
boy!&rdquo; cried one of the men sharply. &ldquo;Calling a
man a thief is a serious business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And being a thief is still more serious,&rdquo; replied
Andy. &ldquo;Perhaps you fancy you can bluff us, as
the saying is, but you are mistaken. This turn-out
is ours, and we are here to claim it. If you molest
us in the least we will hand you all over to the
police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can stand up for ourselves,&rdquo; returned the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
man with a deep scowl. &ldquo;We are three to two, and
we are armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would use force to retain our property,
eh?&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not admit that it is your property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is. Now let me tell you something. We
stopped at the village just north of here, and got
the assistance of nearly a dozen men. They are
scattered about, and should you attempt to molest
us I shall give them a signal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the man addressed,
and springing forward, he clapped his hand over
Andy&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;Tend to the other one, fellows, I
can manage this one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned his companion, and he, as
well as Paul Barberry, fell upon Matt.</p>
<p>The attack had been so sudden that Andy and
Matt were hardly prepared to defend themselves.
The former was forced over on his back, and despite
his utmost exertions, was unable to remove his
assailant&rsquo;s hand from his mouth.</p>
<p>Matt was thrown over on his side, and while Paul
Barberry held one of his arms, the other man tried
to force him into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a single sound and I&rsquo;ll kick you in the
face,&rdquo; he ejaculated in a low, but intense tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; cried Matt, ignoring the threat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
entirely, and he continued to call out so long as his
breath lasted.</p>
<p>The burly ruffian tried to kick him as he had
promised, but with his disengaged hand Matt
caught his foot, and after dancing about to regain
his balance, the man came down heavily across the
young auctioneer&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>The force of the fall was so great that Matt cried
out shrilly with pain. For the moment he imagined
that both of his limbs must be broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clap your hand over his mouth, Barberry!&rdquo;
cried the burly man, as he struggled to regain his
feet. &ldquo;Confound you, boy, I&rsquo;ll teach you to throw
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang at Matt, but not before the young
auctioneer had had a chance to turn over and spring
up. Matt realized what was at stake, and knew he
must fight his best or the worst would happen.</p>
<p>Before the man could touch him Matt placed
Barberry between them. Then he gave the corn
doctor a push that sent him staggering up against
his companion.</p>
<p>In the meantime, poor Andy was still flat on his
back, unable to speak or to move. His assailant
was on top of him, and there did not appear to be
any immediate relief in sight.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Matt, as soon as he had freed himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
leaped to his partner&rsquo;s assistance. He caught
the ruffian by the shoulders, and with a sharp jerk
sent him sprawling flat upon his back on a number
of sharp stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go at them with stones, Andy,&rdquo; shouted Matt,
as he himself stooped to pick up a small rock which
lay at his feet. &ldquo;We ought to show them no
mercy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; panted his partner as he followed
the suggestion by arming himself with several
handy missiles. &ldquo;They are a set of cowards in
my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show you if we are!&rdquo; cried the fellow
who had first attacked Matt. &ldquo;Come on, Barberry,
we must make them prisoners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And once more he sprang forward, while the
fellow on his back, with a groan of pain, staggered
up to lend his assistance in the struggle.</p>
<p>But now came help for Matt and Andy from an
unexpected quarter. There was a crashing through
the brush, and a tall form the thieves did not recognize
burst into view. It was Ramson, the mountaineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s a-going on here, anyway?&rdquo; shouted the
mountaineer in a tone of wonder. &ldquo;Fighting worse
nor a lot of bears, I declare! Wot&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help us, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried Matt. &ldquo;These are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
the fellows who stole the turn-out, and they will
not give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t, hey? Well, it&rsquo;s your&rsquo;n, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is, and if you will help us you shall
have that reward,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;This is the main
thief, and the other two are helping him,&rdquo; and he
pointed to Paul Barberry.</p>
<p>Without more ceremony, the tall mountaineer
strode forward and caught Barberry by the shoulder
and gave him such a twist about that the pretended
doctor howled with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two young men are honest fellows, I take
it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if you imagine you can do them
out of their rights you are mistaken, at least so long
as I am around. Now just you stand still while I
attend to your helpers, and I&rsquo;ll&mdash;hullo! if they ain&rsquo;t
gone and run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramson was right. Hardly had he made his
little speech than Paul Barberry&rsquo;s two companions
had taken time by the forelock and made a rush for
the brush. Matt and Andy dashed after them, but
it was useless, for a few seconds later they disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>BACK TO THE VILLAGE.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, let them go,&rdquo; said Andy, as he saw
the mountaineer make a movement as if to follow
the retreading pair. &ldquo;I do not think that they have
any of the stolen things in their possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they ought to be locked up,&rdquo; insisted Ramson.
&ldquo;Such thieves ought never to be allowed their
liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, but as matters stand, we cannot
bother to follow them just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this fellow will tell us who they were.
I didn&rsquo;t get a square look at them,&rdquo; went on the
mountaineer, who felt sore to think the pair had
gotten away thus easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I imagine we can learn from Barberry who
they are,&rdquo; put in Matt, as he caught the pretended
doctor by the arm. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try to run,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>Paul Barberry appeared greatly disconcerted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
He had not expected this sudden turn of affairs, and
he knew not what to say or do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;March him up to the wagon and light the other
lantern,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I see the fire is going out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon fix that,&rdquo; returned Ramson, and he
threw on some dry twigs, causing the fire to blaze
up merrily. &ldquo;They were making themselves quite
at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; asked
Barberry sullenly, as he found himself surrounded,
with no hope of escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we answer that question we wish to ask
a few on our account,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;Now tell
us who your companions were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple of tramps I picked up in Phillipsburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tramps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I call them. They were bound for
Easton to sell prize packages of toilet soap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fakirs, like yourself,&rdquo; put in Matt. &ldquo;How did
you come to pick them up? Were you afraid to
steal the outfit alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I stole the outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you did, nevertheless. Now, how did
you happen to fall in with those fakirs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me go if I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;We intend to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
put you where you will not be able to steal any
more for some time to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest me?&rdquo; exclaimed Paul Barberry, in great
alarm. Evidently he had not thought such a thing
at all likely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;And unless you do as we
wish you to it may go mighty hard with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll stick to it that I bought the turn-out,&rdquo;
returned the corn salve doctor, trying to put on a
bold front. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to prove that you didn&rsquo;t
make the sale. I won&rsquo;t be bulldozed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a rope and bind him, Matt,&rdquo; said Andy,
paying no attention to the last remark. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take him to the nearest police station. I suppose
there will have to be some papers made out before
he can be taken back to New Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young auctioneer sprang into the wagon and
soon brought forth a long and stout rope. Paul
Barberry watched these preparations with an
anxious face, and when Ramson stepped forward
to aid in making him a close prisoner he began to
wilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, addressing Andy and Matt,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be locked up. It would injure my
reputation to a great extent. I am willing to admit
that I have done wrong, but I&mdash;I&mdash;did it by mistake.
I haven&rsquo;t felt well for several days, and my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
head has been affected, that&rsquo;s the whole truth of the
matter. When I get those spells I don&rsquo;t know what
I am doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good one at crawling,&rdquo; remarked Ramson
in disgust. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get over the spells when he&rsquo;s
locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his protestations and pleadings, Barberry
was tightly bound and fastened to the rear of
the wagon. Then Billy, who had had quite a rest,
was harnessed up once more, and with Matt on
the seat and Ramson going on ahead to pick the
way, they started off for the village, Andy keeping
in the rear to see to it that their prisoner should not
escape.</p>
<p>The way was dark and uncertain, but the tall
mountaineer proved a good and careful guide, and
at the end of an hour and a half the worst part of
the journey was over. They entered the village just
as the town clock was striking one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want the man arrested you had better
take him directly to Justice Harwig&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said
Ramson. &ldquo;He does all the law business in these
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So to that individual&rsquo;s cottage they turned, and
Matt sprang from the wagon and used the old-fashioned
knocker vigorously. A long silence
followed, and then a window upstairs was raised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
and a head adorned with a nightcap was thrust
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a criminal for ye, judge,&rdquo; called out
Ramson. &ldquo;The fellow as run away with that
auction turn-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A criminal, eh? All right, I&rsquo;ll be down in a
minnit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head disappeared and the window was closed.
Five minutes passed and then a light appeared in a
wing of the house, and the justice opened the door
to what he termed his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; he asked in a sleepy
voice.</p>
<p>All hands entered the place, Andy and the
mountaineer leading Paul Barberry, who looked anything
but comfortable. The prisoner was marched up
before the justice&rsquo;s desk, and the others ranged
themselves alongside of him, while Justice Harwig,
a very pleasant man, made himself comfortable to
listen to what all hands might have to say.</p>
<p>The hearing was a short one, and at its conclusion
Paul Barberry was marched off to the village lock-up,
the justice stating that he would notify the
Phillipsburg authorities, so that they could get the
necessary papers and take him away.</p>
<p>Barberry did all he could to beg off, offering at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
the last moment to pay a fine equal to the amount
of money in his pocket&mdash;eighteen dollars. But
neither the justice nor the others would listen to
this. Had he not made the fight, Matt and Andy
might have had some pity on him, but they were
but human and could not so easily forget the blows
they had suffered at the hands of the thieves.</p>
<p>It was not deemed worth while to send out any
one to look for the two men who had escaped, and
after Barberry was safe in jail the young auctioneers
drove over to the tavern and put up there for
the night. Ramson accompanied them, and before
parting with the mountaineer they paid him the
reward that had been promised, for which he was
very thankful.</p>
<p>On the following morning Matt and Andy lost
no time in starting back for Easton, telling Justice
Harwig that they would report to the authorities in
Phillipsburg whenever wanted. They found that
the turn-out had suffered no damage by being stolen.
The new goods which had been in the cases had
been stored away in some confusion, but Andy soon
straightened this out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you we can consider ourselves very lucky
to get out of this so nicely,&rdquo; he said, after he had
finished his work and knew all was right. &ldquo;As it
stands, we will be out hardly a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were lucky,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;But we
wouldn&rsquo;t have been had we taken that freight
agent&rsquo;s advice and remained on the other side of
the Delaware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no doubt he&rsquo;ll be glad to learn that we
have recovered the goods. It saves him something
like seventy-eight dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will lose the best part of to-day&rsquo;s trade, for
we won&rsquo;t be able to get back much before two or
three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, the city is full of people, and we
ought to do best in the evening,&rdquo; replied Andy.</p>
<p>It was a cool, clear day, and although both were
rather tired from the adventures of the night before,
they enjoyed the drive back to Easton. At
first Andy drove, while Matt took it easy on the
goods in the back of the wagon, and when half the
distance was covered the partners changed places,
so that by the time the store they had previously
hired was reached, both were sufficiently rested to
go ahead with the duties on hand.</p>
<p>They lost no time in transferring the stock to the
store shelves, after which Andy drove off with the
wagon and found a stable where the turn-out might
be put up during their stay. Matt arranged the
stock on the shelves, and made a great window display.
The red flag was hung out, and inside of an
hour afterward business was in full swing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>UNDESIRABLE CUSTOMERS.</h3>
</div>
<p>Among their customers they numbered a great
many fire laddies, and these they made it a point to
treat extra well, selling them goods at almost cost.
As a consequence the firemen told their friends, and
by eight o&rsquo;clock that evening the store was packed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be the banner day after all,&rdquo;
whispered Andy, just after making several good
sales. &ldquo;I believe we can keep things moving until
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found a great demand for pocket-knives
and cheap jewelry, and by playing on the instruments
they sold over three dozen mouth harmonicas
and three accordions. Then Andy and Matt gave
a duet on the violin and banjo, and as a consequence,
sold both of the instruments they had
handled.</p>
<p>The music had attracted even a greater crowd,
and among the people were four tall and rather
ugly-looking colored men. They shoved their way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
forward rudely, causing some timid customers to
leave in a hurry, and then began to laugh and joke
among themselves in a loud and coarse manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we are going to have trouble with
those chaps,&rdquo; whispered Matt to his partner.
&ldquo;They have been drinking, and they are out for a
lark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea, too,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;We
must watch them closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few minutes the young auctioneers paid no
attention to the four negroes, excepting to see that
they did not take up something without laying it
down again. The fellows moved around through
the crowd, and at length two of them leaned up
heavily against one of the show-cases which belonged
to the store fixtures.</p>
<p>The combined weight of the two men was too
much for the top glass of the case, and with a sharp
crack it broke into half a dozen pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! dat glass dun gone and got broke!&rdquo;
cried one of the negroes. &ldquo;I wonder how dat
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You broke that glass!&rdquo; exclaimed Matt sharply.
&ldquo;You and your companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; returned the offender in pretended surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&mdash;and your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Dat ain&rsquo;t so at all, boss! We didn&rsquo;t touch dat
yere glass. Did we, Jeff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed we didn&rsquo;t, Tooker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come in here to do no kind ob damage,
boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what you came in for,&rdquo; returned
Matt. &ldquo;You broke the glass and you will have to
pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the young auctioneer&rsquo;s statement the faces of
all four of the colored men took on a savage look.
They had drifted in to do pretty much as they
pleased, and had not expected to meet with such
strong and sudden opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pay for nuffin!&rdquo; growled the ringleader
of the quartet. &ldquo;I dun reckon somebody else in
the crowd broke the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cos da did,&rdquo; replied another of the colored
men. &ldquo;Maybe yo&rsquo; think yo&rsquo; kin lay it on us just
because we is colored, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; a colored man can be as much of a
gentleman as any one&mdash;if he wishes to be,&rdquo; put in
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do youse mean to insinuate dat we ain&rsquo;t
gen&rsquo;men?&rdquo; questioned one of the crowd roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not gentlemen when you break glass
and refuse to pay for it,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
glass is worth at least a dollar, and unless it is paid
for, somebody will be handed over to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! do yo&rsquo; fink yo&rsquo; kin scare us, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; say another word an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll do up de hull
place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We is as good as any white trash, remember
dat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime one of the colored men slid his
hand into the show-case which had been damaged,
and essayed to grab a small box of watch-chains
which rested close by. Matt saw the movement,
slick as it was, just in time, and springing forward
he caught the colored man by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that box!&rdquo; he cried sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t gwine to take de box,&rdquo; returned
the would-be offender. &ldquo;I was jess gwine to look
at yo&rsquo; stock. How much is dem chains worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not selling chains to you to-night,&rdquo; returned
Matt.</p>
<p>He had hardly spoken when Andy leaned over
his shoulder and whispered into his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to them for a few minutes, and I&rsquo;ll slip
out and notify the police. Treat them well until I
get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the next instant Matt&rsquo;s partner had disappeared
into the crowd, without any of the colored
men noticing his departure.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t want to sell me any chain?&rdquo; repeated
the colored man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t chain night. I&rsquo;m selling harmonicas
and banjos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see some banjos den,&rdquo; put in another
of the negroes, and he winked at his companions,
thinking that Matt had become too scared to refer
to the broken show-case again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but I don&rsquo;t want any more show-cases
broken,&rdquo; returned the young auctioneer.</p>
<p>He took a banjo from one of the cases and began
to tune it up slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kin yo&rsquo; play us a jig?&rdquo; asked one of the colored
men, while the white people in the place looked on
in wonder at the turn affairs had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can play a jig,&rdquo; returned Matt
coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den give us one now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to wait until I am done tuning
up, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt tuned up more slowly than ever, and even
allowed one of the strings to break that he might
gain an extra minute in repairing the damage. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
last, after fully five minutes had passed, the banjo
was in order for use, and the young auctioneer
struck off a few chords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now give us dat jig if yo&rsquo; kin play it,&rdquo; said the
colored man impatiently. He was the same who
had tried to steal the box of chains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t play a jig until you and your companion
pay for the glass you broke,&rdquo; returned Matt
shortly, and he laid down the instrument abruptly,
and folded his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot?&rdquo; roared the colored men in concert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here; do yo&rsquo; want us to smash de hull
place?&rdquo; demanded the ringleader of the disturbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll smash anything more,&rdquo;
replied Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, hey? We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colored man made a movement as if to strike
the young auctioneer in the face. But before the
blow could land he was hauled back by a strong
arm. He and his companions looked around and
found themselves confronted by two policemen
whom Andy had fortunately met upon the corner
below.</p>
<p>The two colored men who had kept somewhat in
the background at once sneaked through the crowd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
and escaped through the open doorway. The other
two, the ones who had done the damage, were held
by the policemen, much to their discomfiture.</p>
<p>A lively talk followed, and then upon payment
for the damage done, the colored men were allowed
to go, first being warned by Matt and Andy not to
show themselves in the store again. Had they not
paid up they would have been arrested.</p>
<p>After this scene was ended one of the policemen
remained in the vicinity of the place for all the
while the store remained open. But nothing more
occurred to disturb the auction sales.</p>
<p>Business in Easton was so good that they remained
there until Tuesday of the following week.
During that time they took in nearly two hundred
dollars, leaving them a profit, after all expenses
were met, of forty-five dollars.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning Matt and Andy were called
to Belvidere, the county seat, to testify against Barberry
for the robbery at Phillipsburg. Strange to
say, Barberry pleaded guilty, so the two boys had
no trouble in the way of being detained as witnesses
against him. The corn salve doctor was held for
sentence.</p>
<p>After leaving Easton Matt and Andy struck out
for Bethlehem and Allentown. The weather was
now growing gradually colder, but they calculated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
that they would have at least a month of weather
which would be fit to travel in, even in this mountainous
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Allentown we can stop long enough for me
to take a trip to Philadelphia and buy goods,&rdquo; remarked
Andy as they were driving out of Easton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;I am glad
we have to stock up so often, and I am looking forward
to the time when it will be necessary for us
to buy a larger wagon and get another horse to put
beside Billy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will hardly pay us to buy another horse this
fall. You must remember that we are to locate in
some place during the winter. I have no desire
to move around much when the thermometer is
below the freezing point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon on the outskirts of Easton, and
then they struck a rather rough road leading over
numerous hills and around jagged rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jinks! I believe we have missed the way,&rdquo;
remarked Matt, as at last he brought Billy to a
standstill. &ldquo;That stable-keeper said the road was
a good one, and I fail to find this so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop at the next house and find out,&rdquo;
returned Andy. &ldquo;Do you see any place in sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a cottage down in the hollow yonder.
Stay here with Billy, and I&rsquo;ll ask the way there.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>Matt sprang from the wagon and was soon hurrying
across a barren bit of pasture land that led
down to a brook which was all but dried up. The
cottage stood upon the bank of the brook, and
walking up to it, the young auctioneer rapped upon
the door.</p>
<p>There was an exclamation of surprise from
within, and then he was asked to enter. He did
so, and was greatly vexed to find himself in the
presence of three of the colored men who had
created the disturbance in the store but a few
nights before!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>A DASH FROM DANGER.</h3>
</div>
<p>Had Matt known that he would meet three of the
colored men in the cottage in the hollow, it is more
than likely that he would not have gone near the
place.</p>
<p>When he and Andy had had the trouble at the
store, the two men who had been compelled to pay
for the broken glass had gone off in anything but a
happy frame of mind, and the young auctioneer had
then remarked to his partner that they might have
trouble with the men should they chance to meet
them away from police protection.</p>
<p>Matt saw at once that the negroes recognized
him, and that his reception would be far from
agreeable. Had he been less courageous he would
have turned and fled, but as it was, he stood his
ground.</p>
<p>All three of the colored men had been seated
around a kitchen table playing cards, but at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
entrance the two who had been the primary cause
of the former trouble sprang to their feet and came
toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! what brings yo&rsquo; heah?&rdquo; demanded the
ringleader of the mischief-makers wrathfully.</p>
<p>For the instant Matt hardly knew how to reply.
He recognized his mistake in coming to the cottage,
and he was anxious now to make as early a departure
as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you live here?&rdquo; he asked boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes we do,&rdquo; returned the colored man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have made a mistake in coming here. I
thought some one else might live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he took a step backward to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hol&rsquo; on!&rdquo; exclaimed the colored man, coming
still closer. &ldquo;What brung yo&rsquo; heah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to find out if we were on the right
road, that was all. But I can find out elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s yo&rsquo; wagon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over on the road,&rdquo; and Matt waved his hand in
the direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gwine to leave Easton?&rdquo; questioned the second
colored man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had Matt made the reply than the three
colored men glanced at each other, and the ringleader
whispered to his companions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;See yeah, yo&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t gwine befo&rsquo; we is squar&rsquo; wid
yo&rsquo;!&rdquo; he cried, as he caught Matt by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; exclaimed the young auctioneer.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand being molested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about dat!&rdquo; cried the second colored
man, and he also caught hold of Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close dat doah, Shelby!&rdquo; went on the ringleader,
to the man still at the table. &ldquo;Dis is just
de chance we wanted at dis yeah boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man addressed at once arose, and rushing to
the somewhat rickety door, not only closed it, but
also locked it.</p>
<p>Matt viewed this movement with increased
alarm, and squirmed to release himself, but without
avail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; can&rsquo;t git away from us, nohow!&rdquo; cried the
ringleader, as he squeezed the young auctioneer&rsquo;s
arm until Matt thought he would crack a bone.
&ldquo;We is gwine for to teach you a lesson, boy, dat yo&rsquo;
won&rsquo;t forgit in a long while!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; yelled Matt, without more ado,
realizing that the situation was becoming suddenly
desperate.</p>
<p>He had barely time to repeat his cry when the
ringleader of the negroes clapped his big hand over
his mouth. Then he was forced over backward
upon the floor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go frough his pockets, Jeff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s wot I intends to do, Tooker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a putty good watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s got a lot o&rsquo; money, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rascals began to go through Matt&rsquo;s pockets,
and he called Jeff made a movement toward relieving
the boy of his watch and chain.</p>
<p>The timepiece had once belonged to Mr. Lincoln,
and to the young auctioneer it was a valuable heirloom.
The thought that he was to be deprived of
it angered him more than did anything else, and he
began to kick out hotly right and left.</p>
<p>The negroes were not prepared for this, and before
they could guard against it, one received a severe
blow in the chin, and the other had the toe of Matt&rsquo;s
shoe nearly knock out his eye. They both gave
sharp cries of pain and fell back, and taking advantage
of this Matt leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open that!&rdquo; he commanded, to the third negro,
who stood with his back against the door. &ldquo;Open
that before I make it warm for you also!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the colored man would not budge, and Matt
was compelled to attack him in his fight for freedom.</p>
<p>The young auctioneer was thoroughly aroused,
and now showed what muscle he had gained during
his free-and-easy life on the road. He attacked the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
man without hesitation, and forcing him aside,
compelled him to keep away from the door by
blows and kicks delivered with surprising rapidity.</p>
<p>The man had, at the last moment, taken the key
from the lock and thrown it in the far corner of the
room. Not waiting to recover this, Matt began to
hammer at the door, and gathering himself together,
threw his whole weight against it.</p>
<p>As has been said, the door was a rickety one, and
it went down with a crash, tumbling the young
auctioneer upon his face just outside the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! what on earth does this mean?&rdquo; cried a
voice close by, and Andy rushed up, a look of blank
astonishment plainly depicted upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those negroes!&rdquo; gasped Matt, struggling to rise
from amid the wreckage of the door. &ldquo;Come on,
don&rsquo;t wait, for they are three to two, and they are
just drunk enough to be as ugly as sin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught Andy by the arm, and before the latter
could ask for a further explanation, hurried him up
the hill toward the wagon.</p>
<p>The negroes came out of the cottage and made
after them, but only for a short distance. Then
they came to a sudden halt, and after a brief consultation,
hurried back to the cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose they went back for&mdash;pistols
and razors?&rdquo; questioned Andy, as they reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
the turn-out, and he unhitched Billy from the tree
to which he had been tied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are afraid we are going after the
police,&rdquo; returned Matt, springing up to the seat.
&ldquo;Every one of that crowd ought to be in jail this
minute!&rdquo; he went on bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they do to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly robbed me!&rdquo; And in a few brief words
he related what had happened to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you want to go back to Easton and
make a complaint?&rdquo; asked Andy, when he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am sick of having to do with the police,
Andy. All I want is to be let alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my sentiment, Matt. We are out for
business&mdash;and money&mdash;not trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy sprang up beside Matt, and it was soon decided
by the partners to continue on the road until
another house should appear. They looked back,
but saw nothing more of the negroes, and then
started off.</p>
<p>They passed through a bit of woods and down a
long hill. Here they found a neat farmhouse, where
a pleasant enough woman was sitting upon the doorstep,
knitting socks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one road, but it is not the best road,&rdquo;
replied the woman, in reply to Andy&rsquo;s question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
regarding the way to Bethlehem. &ldquo;But now you
are this far, you had better keep on, for it will be
harder to turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it to the town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not over a mile and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is the road fairly good from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; you can get along very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will continue,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;By
the way,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;do you know anything of
the negroes that live in the cottage back a ways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s face lost its smile and she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know them only too well,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;They have stolen so many of our chickens and so
much garden truck that my husband is going to
make a complaint against them. I wish they would
leave the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust your husband succeeds in having them
all locked up,&rdquo; put in Matt, &ldquo;for they richly deserve
it.&rdquo; And after a few words more with the farmer&rsquo;s
wife they passed on.</p>
<p>It was getting on toward noon when they finally
arrived at Bethlehem, that pretty little town on the
Lehigh River. They drove past several of the silk
mills, and finally found a livery stable, at which
Billy and the wagon were put up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if we might do some business here,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
said Andy, as they started for a restaurant for dinner.
&ldquo;Let us open up this afternoon if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we hire a store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us try to sell from the wagon first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately after dinner they procured a license
and found a suitable corner. They did all in their
power to attract a crowd, and finally, toward evening,
when the working people were on their way
home, succeeded in bringing quite an assemblage
around them.</p>
<p>But, strange to say, they could not make a single
sale, try their best. Both used up all their eloquence;
Matt played on the banjo and mouth harmonica,
and Andy told funny stories. It was no
use; the crowd merely smiled or frowned, and then
one after another drifted away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst luck yet,&rdquo; whispered Andy to
Matt. &ldquo;I never dreamed that we would strike anything
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stout German who stood in the crowd saw the
look of wonder and disappointment on Andy&rsquo;s face,
and he laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ton&rsquo;t vos caught der same pirds twice
alretty!&rdquo; he chuckled to several bystanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; questioned Matt, who overheard
the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ton&rsquo;t vos caught der same pirds twice mit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
der same salt,&rdquo; returned the German, and he
laughed heartily at what he considered a good joke,
while those around smiled and nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t see the joke,&rdquo; said Matt
cheerfully. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let me in the secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dose udder fellers vos schwindle us, put you
can&rsquo;t do it twice times!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other fellows swindled you?&rdquo; repeated Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dose fellers mit dot wagon vot vas here all
last week. I don&rsquo;t dink but vot you vos der same
crowd of fellers!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>DANGEROUS MOUNTAIN TRAVELING.</h3>
</div>
<p>Both Matt and Andy began to smell a mouse, as
the saying is, and they lost no time in questioning
not only the German, but several other people that
remained around the wagon.</p>
<p>The young auctioneers soon learned that a rival
party of auctioneers with a large two-horse wagon
had stopped at the town during the entire previous
week, and sold goods which were next to worthless,
for the highest prices to be obtained. They had
been cool and shrewd men, thoroughly dishonest,
and they had swindled every one who had had dealings
with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did they go to?&rdquo; asked Andy, of
the German, after the matter had been talked over
for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve ton&rsquo;t know. Of ve did ve vould tar an&rsquo;
fedder dem, py chiminy!&rdquo; was the emphatic reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it, we won&rsquo;t be able to do any business
here,&rdquo; said Matt, and though they remained in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
Bethlehem the remainder of that day and all of the
next, his words proved true. Only a few trifles
were sold, and these at prices that did not reimburse
them for the trouble of handling.</p>
<p>Seeing that it would not pay to remain in the
town longer, they started once more on the road,
and by the end of the week found themselves
established in a store in Allentown, and doing quite
a good business.</p>
<p>While in this city Andy made a trip to Philadelphia,
and had several more cases of goods shipped
on, which Matt was careful to procure before they
might be stolen from the freight depot. The wagon
was also sent to a repair shop and thoroughly overhauled,
for the roads beyond Allentown promised
to be rougher than those heretofore traversed.</p>
<p>Both Matt and Andy were curious to know more
about the rival auctioneers, and they wondered if
they would meet the men. Nothing had been heard
of them in Allentown, so that their business in that
city was not injured. They did fairly well, although
a strike in some of the mills made business duller
than it would otherwise have been.</p>
<p>But both of the partners thought they had no
cause for complaint. During the time they had
been away from home they had cleared, above all
expenses, one hundred and seventy-two dollars,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
which, equally divided, was eighty-six dollars
apiece&mdash;not a fortune, but still an amount which
Matt at least viewed with considerable satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do as well right straight through,&rdquo; he
said, as he and Andy talked it over on their way to
Lehighton and Mauch Chunk, &ldquo;we will have quite
an amount to place to our credit in the bank by the
time we reach New York again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in hopes that we will do even better as
cold weather comes on,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;Folks
seem to buy more then&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why. And
besides, after stopping at Mauch Chunk, we will
only go to large places, for I think it will pay to
skip the smaller ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what you are right. I know
one thing that I am going to do when I get to
Mauch Chunk&mdash;that is, if business continues good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to buy a post-office order and send
Miss Bartlett the money she so kindly loaned me.
Won&rsquo;t she be surprised to get it back so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, Matt. It was very kind of her
to loan it to you. I suppose you are going to pay
her the interest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the full year,&rdquo; finished the boy. &ldquo;And at
Christmas, if I can do it, I&rsquo;m going to make her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
some sort of a nice present. She is the only friend
I had left in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very nice young lady,&rdquo; returned Andy, and
then he went on, with a short laugh: &ldquo;I wonder
what old Caleb Gulligan would say if he knew of
our prosperity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wonder what Mr. Randolph Fenton
would say if he knew how I was doing? I hope
when I write to Miss Bartlett that she lets him
know,&rdquo; went on Matt. &ldquo;I suppose he thought that
after he discharged me I would go to the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, men like him very often imagine the world
cannot possibly get along without them. I reckon
you are glad that you are no longer in his employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad isn&rsquo;t a strong enough word, Andy. It
makes me shudder to look back at the times I spent
in his offices, being bossed around and scolded from
morning to night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think traveling around has done us both a
deal of good, Matt. I feel stronger than I have in
years, and you look the picture of health, barring
those bruises you received from Barberry and his
companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I feel fine! Outdoor life always did agree
with me. When I was in Fenton&rsquo;s offices I felt
very much like a prisoner in a jail. I wouldn&rsquo;t go
back to that life again for the world!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>Thus the talk ran on, from one subject to another.
Andy had given his young partner the full particulars
of his own roving life, and in return Matt had
related everything concerning himself, and the two
felt as if they had known each other for years; in
fact, as Matt once stated later on, they were more
like brothers than mere partners in business.</p>
<p>Andy was deeply interested in the fact of Mr.
Lincoln&rsquo;s disappearance, and he wondered nearly as
much as did Matt himself if the unfortunate man
would ever turn up again.</p>
<p>As for the boy, he could not bring himself to believe
that his parent was dead, and although he
rarely mentioned his father&rsquo;s name, he was constantly
on the watch for him, and often when they
were stopping at a place he would go off on what
he termed a &ldquo;still hunt,&rdquo; hoping thereby to pick up
a stray bit of information which would put him on
the right track to learn of his father&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>The drive up through Walnut Port to Lehigh
Gap was very nice. At the latter place they stopped
over night, and then pushed on to Lehighton, sometimes
along the river, and then by way of a road
through and around the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This scenery is just grand!&rdquo; cried Matt, as they
were driving on about ten o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
&ldquo;Just look at that mountain over yonder! And
see how the river winds along through the valley
below here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very fine, indeed!&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ll tell you what: I would rather be on horseback
than in the wagon. It seems to me that some of
the bends around the mountain side are positively
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not, Andy. Why, look, there is a
regular wagon road. If other wagons can pass
along here, I fancy we can do so, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other wagons may not be as heavy as ours, with
that big case tied on behind. Don&rsquo;t you notice how
Billy slips every once in awhile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might have had him shod sharp when
we had the wagon overhauled,&rdquo; returned Matt
slowly, as he noticed for the first time that Billy did
slip more than usual. &ldquo;We can have it done during
our stop at Mauch Chunk or at Lehighton, if it
becomes necessary. Maybe we are on the wrong
road again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, certainly this road is growing worse instead
of better,&rdquo; said Andy soberly. &ldquo;Just look at
that turn ahead! The road isn&rsquo;t over ten feet wide,
and it slopes down to that steep hill&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive as close to the inside wall as you can,&rdquo;
was Matt&rsquo;s somewhat nervous reply, as he saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
the possible danger ahead. &ldquo;Steady now, Billy,
steady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse moved along slowly up to the curve
which ran around the mountain side. As Andy
had said, the road at this point was scarcely ten
feet wide, and on the other side was a steep downward
slope, terminating below at a tiny brook filled
with loose rocks.</p>
<p>The curve was reached, and the two were just
congratulating themselves upon having passed the
dangerous spot in safety, when a large bird, flying
from a near-by bush, frightened Billy and caused
him to shy to one side.</p>
<p>In another instant the wagon was at the very
edge of the slope!</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXII_AN_INTERESTING_LETTER' id='CHAPTER_XXXII_AN_INTERESTING_LETTER'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>AN INTERESTING LETTER.</h3>
</div>
<p>To Andy and Matt it looked as if the entire turn-out
must slide down the hillside to the bottom, there
to be smashed into a hundred pieces.</p>
<p>It was small wonder, therefore, that both gave a
loud cry of alarm and that both caught at the lines
to lead Billy away from the danger so imminent.</p>
<p>The horse continued to move ahead, but instead
of drawing closer to the inside, he walked upon the
very outer edge of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lead him!&rdquo; cried Andy, and while Matt continued
to hold the lines, he sprang out and caught
Billy by the bridle.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the faithful animal would have come
along willingly, but he now seemed to grow obstinate,
and pulled back when Andy caught hold. The
wagon stopped, and then the rear wheels were sent
partly down the slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull him up!&rdquo; cried Matt. &ldquo;Pull him, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; gasped Andy, tugging at the
bridle with might and main.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he must come! The wagon will go down
in another second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, I can&rsquo;t make him come,&rdquo; panted
Andy, between his clinched teeth, as he renewed
the struggle to bring the wagon up on the level
once more.</p>
<p>Tying the lines fast, Matt sprang out. He had
seen a loose stone of fair size close at hand, and this
he now picked up. Running around to the rear of
the wagon, he placed it on the sloping ground so
that one of the wheels was blocked from further
slipping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Can you find another
stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to push on the other wheel. Get up,
Billy, get up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt placed his shoulder to the wheel, and exerted
all of his strength, and seeing this, Andy also
urged the horse. Billy gave a tug&mdash;there was a
moment&rsquo;s strain&mdash;and then the turn-out rolled up
once more upon the level road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness for that!&rdquo; burst out Andy.
&ldquo;I thought for a moment that it was a goner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I, Andy. You had better lead him until
we reach a safer bit of the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to do that. And after this I&rsquo;ll know
enough to lead him around such a bend, instead of
taking such a dangerous chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a hundred feet further on the mountain road
left the proximity of the slope, and then the two
once more climbed up on the seat. Billy, the
horse, did not appear to be in the least disturbed
over the adventure, but Matt and Andy were bathed
in a cold perspiration which did not leave them until
some time after.</p>
<p>At Lehighton, where they stopped for dinner,
they determined to drive right through to Mauch
Chunk, four miles further on. Many people from
the former place did their trading at Mauch Chunk,
and the young auctioneers thought they would
catch just as much trade by not stopping on the
way.</p>
<p>At Mauch Chunk a stop was made for three days,
and during that time there were several excursions
to the place from New York and Philadelphia, the
city folks coming up to see the autumnal beauties
of Glen Onoko and the various mountains through
which the Switchback gravity road runs. These
crowds helped business some, and the stay proved
nearly as profitable as the one at Easton had been.</p>
<p>On the first day at Mauch Chunk Matt procured
the money order of which he had spoken, and sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
it to Ida Bartlett, with a long letter, in which he
thanked her for her kindness, and gave her an
account of the trip since leaving the metropolis.
He stated that if she wished to write to him within
the week to address the letter to Wilkesbarre, or,
on the following week to Scranton, as they were
bound for both places.</p>
<p>During their spare hours both Andy and Matt
took the ride on the gravity road and enjoyed it
very much. The rhododendrons were out in full
bloom, and Matt wished he could send Ida Bartlett
a bunch of the beautiful flowers.</p>
<p>They were soon once again on the road. But
Billy&rsquo;s shoes had been carefully attended to, and
now they were very careful whenever they came to
a spot that looked at all dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One scare is enough,&rdquo; was the way Andy put it,
and Matt thoroughly agreed with him.</p>
<p>After leaving Mauch Chunk they passed through
Penn Haven and Leslie Run, and so on to White
Haven. At the latter place they stopped for two
days, but found it very unprofitable, as there was
little or no money afloat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have to take the bad with the good,&rdquo;
said Andy, in reply to Matt&rsquo;s remark concerning
the dullness of trade. &ldquo;We cannot expect to make
money wherever we go. If that was to be done, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
reckon there would be many other auctioneers in
the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me: I wonder what has become
of those auctioneers we heard of in Bethlehem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. But it is likely that we
will hear from them again, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On leaving White Haven for Wilkesbarre, they
struck the first snow-storm of the season. It was
not a heavy storm, and yet, as the wind blew in
their faces, the drive of thirty miles proved anything
but pleasant. They were glad enough when
the city was reached, and they were able to put up
the turn-out at a livery stable and warm up around
the office stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be able to travel much longer, if this
keeps on,&rdquo; remarked Andy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to pick
out some place to settle down in for the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any place in view?&rdquo; asked Matt, with
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my eye on Middletown, New York
State. That&rsquo;s a lively place, and it gets a trade
from a good many miles around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we can make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. We can go from Scranton to Carbondale,
and Honesdale, and so on through Lackawaxen
and Port Jervis. By taking that route we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
can stop on the way and still reach Middletown inside
of two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t like to miss a letter from Miss
Bartlett, if it was sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can leave directions to forward it if it comes
after we are gone. The post-office authorities will
willingly send the letter wherever you direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she has already written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think so, why don&rsquo;t you call at the post-office
and find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;as soon as we have had something to eat
and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed over to the Commercial Hotel, and
after brushing up, entered the dining-room. Here
a late dinner was served for them, and it is needless
to say that both did full justice to all that was set
before them.</p>
<p>After they had finished Andy went off to hunt
up an empty store, and Matt, after securing directions,
walked off to the post-office.</p>
<p>To his delight, there was a letter for him, and
addressed in Ida Bartlett&rsquo;s hand. As it was the
first letter he had received since being on the road,
the reader can understand his curiosity to master its
contents. Standing back in an out-of-the-way spot
of the corridor, he split open the envelope with his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
penknife, and was soon reading that which had been
written.</p>
<p>The letter surprised him not a little. After
acknowledging the receipt of the money order and
congratulating him upon his evident success, Ida
Bartlett wrote as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Matt, I am going to tell you something
that I think will interest you even more than
it does me. It is about Mr. Fenton and the mining
shares which he once sold your father. Last week
Mr. Gaston, the bookkeeper, had a quarrel with Mr.
Fenton, and was discharged. Before he left, however,
he and Mr. Fenton had some high words,
which I, being in the next office, could not help
hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During this quarrel something was said about
the shares sold to William Lincoln, and Mr. Gaston
said that if the papers in connection with the shares
which your father had bought could be recovered,
he would expose Mr. Fenton. I could not understand
the whole drift of the matter, but Mr. Fenton
seemed to be glad that your father was missing&mdash;he
said he was most likely dead&mdash;and that the papers
had disappeared with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything of the papers? Mr.
Gaston has gone to Boston, but I could write to him
if you think that Mr. Fenton is a swindler and that
you can get back any money which he may have
defrauded your father out of. I myself am going
to leave Mr. Fenton&rsquo;s employ on the first of next
month, having secured a better place with another
firm of brokers. Let me hear from you again as
soon as possible. I hope if he has any money
belonging to your father you can get it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h3>THE RIVAL AUCTIONEERS.</h3>
</div>
<p>It may well be imagined that Matt read Ida
Bartlett&rsquo;s letter with great interest. The young
auctioneer had never received a communication as
surprising as was this one.</p>
<p>He went over every word carefully several times,
then placed the letter in his pocket, and started off
to find Andy.</p>
<p>Half an hour later he came across his partner on
the main street. Andy had just rented a store, one
of two vacant ones which were side by side, and
was now on his way to drive the wagon around and
unload the stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you get a letter, Matt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough. Any special news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Just read that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the young auctioneer passed the communication
over for his partner&rsquo;s perusal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>Andy read the letter as carefully as had Matt.
He emitted a long, low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what to think, Matt. Do you
know anything about this mining share business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that Randolph Fenton sold my father
some shares, that is all. I never saw the certificates,
if that is what they are called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the papers in connection with
the shares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must have been in your father&rsquo;s
possession when he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Mother might have
had them when father was first sent to the asylum
for treatment. Although I remember hearing her
once say that since father&rsquo;s mind had become
affected he would not trust any one with his affairs,
but kept all his money and papers hidden away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad you haven&rsquo;t the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so. If I had them I would hunt up Mr.
Gaston, and get him to expose Randolph Fenton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might pay you to do that anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. If there was any likelihood of
this being the case, I think Miss Bartlett would
have written to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you intend to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to write to her again, telling her
just how matters stand with me, and ask her if she
thinks it will do any good for me to come on. If
she thinks it will, I&rsquo;ll try to manage it some way to
take a run to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that whenever you wish, Matt. I
will take care of things the same as you did when
I was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way to the stable where the wagon and
Billy were located they talked the matter over at a
greater length. Andy took a warm personal interest
in the matter, and did not hesitate to say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this Fenton swindled your father, I trust you
are able to prove it and get your money back,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any one that deserves
money more than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wagon was soon driven around to the store,
and the goods unloaded. Then the show-window
and the shelves were arranged to attract the eye,
after which Andy hung out the red flag, which now
began to look to the young auctioneers like an old
friend.</p>
<p>As soon as everything was in shape for business
Matt brought out paper, pen and ink, and set to
work upon the letter to Ida Bartlett. At first he
hardly knew how to express himself, but before he
had finished he had filled eight pages, and told the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
young lady exactly how matters stood. He begged
for her further assistance, and assured her that she
should not lose through her kindness to him.</p>
<p>The letter finished, Matt did not place it in a
letter-box, but marched with it to the post-office,
that it might be included with the first out-going
New York mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only could find father,&rdquo; he sighed to himself
as he turned back to the store. &ldquo;Something in
my heart tells me that he is not dead, and yet, if
this is so, where can he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On arriving at the store he found Andy already
busy with a crowd which had begun to collect the
moment that the red flag was hung out. Matt had
to begin work at once, and this was a good thing
for the boy, for it kept him from brooding over his
parent&rsquo;s possible fate and thus growing melancholy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am any kind of a judge, we are going to do
the best business yet at this city,&rdquo; said Andy, as
there came a little lull in trade. &ldquo;It started off
briskly, and it has kept on steadily ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that just suits me,&rdquo; laughed Matt. &ldquo;To
my way of thinking we cannot do too much business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next day Matt noticed two sharp-eyed
men hanging around the place a good deal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
At first he paid no attention to them, but at last
pointed them out to Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I noticed them myself,&rdquo; returned the senior
partner. &ldquo;They do not look as if they wanted to
buy, but just as if they were spying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing I call them in and ask them to buy?&rdquo;
suggested Matt, for both of the men were at that
moment gazing in the window at the articles displayed
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, you can do that if you want to,&rdquo;
returned Andy.</p>
<p>So Matt walked from behind the counter toward
the door, but before he could reach it one of the
men saw him and spoke to his companion, and both
hurried up the street and around the nearest corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! that&rsquo;s queer, to say the least,&rdquo; said the
young auctioneer, and Andy agreed with him.</p>
<p>There had been a &ldquo;To Let&rdquo; bill upon the show-window
of the vacant store next door, but on the
following morning when the young auctioneers
opened up they found the bill gone. The door of
the store was open, and inside a boy somewhat
younger than Matt was cleaning up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried Matt, stopping short. Then he
poked his head in at the door and confronted the
boy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So we are going to have neighbors, eh?&rdquo; he
remarked pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet your life!&rdquo; was the slangy reply from the
boy, as soon as he had noted who had addressed
him. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect us, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know the store was taken until a
moment ago,&rdquo; said Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped. It was the only store
vacant in the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be helped?&rdquo; repeated Matt, somewhat
puzzled. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought you might object to our opening
up alongside of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should. What business are
you in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt was taken aback somewhat by this unexpected
reply, and his face showed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you are going to open an
auction store here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, and we are going to make it everlastingly
warm for you fellows, too,&rdquo; went on the boy
triumphantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been a-watching how you
run things, and we are going to scoop every bit of
trade when we get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt drew a long breath. Here was certainly a
new experience. He and Andy had expected to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
encounter rivals, but had never dreamed of having
them at such close quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we will have to stand it,&rdquo; he
said, hardly knowing how else to reply to the boy&rsquo;s
bragging statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you I&rsquo;d pack up and try some other
place,&rdquo; went on the boy. &ldquo;Gissem &amp; Fillow will
take every bit of trade&mdash;they always do wherever
they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gissem &amp; Fillow? Are those the names of the
men who run the concern?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they are the slickest auctioneers in
the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you only think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it. I&rsquo;ll bet you a new hat you
don&rsquo;t take in a dollar after we get a-going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I don&rsquo;t bet. May I ask where
you came from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came from Stroudsburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you down in Bethlehem before that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. How did you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came through there after you had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet you didn&rsquo;t sell anything. We squeezed the
town dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t sell much,&rdquo; returned Matt. He was
on the point of stating that he had heard how the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
folks had been swindled, but he changed his mind.
&ldquo;How long do you expect to remain here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a week or so. You might as well pack up
and leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we will venture to remain, at least a day
or two longer,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll be able
to do a little in spite of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment a large wagon began to back up
to the curb. The seat was occupied by two men,
and Matt at once recognized them as the fellows he
had caught hanging around the previous day. They
were the rival auctioneers, who had been watching
to learn how Matt and Andy conducted their
business.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>MATT SPEAKS HIS MIND.</h3>
</div>
<p>Matt did not wait to encounter the rival auctioneers,
but walked away and entered the door of his
own store. Andy was busy, dusting up, and to his
partner he told what he had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; whistled Andy. &ldquo;That will make matters
rather interesting. Is that their wagon out
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is. Those are the same two men, I
am certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are. Well, if they are the swindlers
folks in Bethlehem said they were we ought not to
fear them. People are not fools, and they soon
learn if a man is honest or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may take away a good bit of trade, nevertheless,
Andy. And we were just congratulating
ourselves on what a fine week we were going to
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do our best, Matt. This puts me on
my mettle.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>They talked the matter over a bit, and then set
to work to &ldquo;put their best foot forward,&rdquo; as Andy
termed it. The window was cleaned as it had never
been cleaned before, and also the show-cases and
shelves, and then they proceeded to make the most
elaborate display possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There; that ought to attract people, if anything
will,&rdquo; remarked Andy, when the work was finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right; the window couldn&rsquo;t look better.
But perhaps they will put out big price signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, they can&rsquo;t afford to sell any cheaper
than we can. I bought all the goods at bottom
figures. Let us start up before they get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began to play on several instruments, and
as soon as half a dozen people were collected Andy
began to talk and tell jokes. Before the rival auctioneers
had their stock inside of their store Matt
and Andy were doing a pretty fair business.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Gissem &amp; Fillow hurried up their
preparations, and by noon both places were &ldquo;going
it for all they were worth,&rdquo; as Matt expressed it.</p>
<p>Gissem seemed to be the principal member of the
firm, Fillow and the boy being merely helpers. He
was a tall, thin-faced and clean-shaven man, with
hard, steely-blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way for bargains!&rdquo; he cried out, coming
out upon the sidewalk. &ldquo;This way, gents and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
ladies! The only place in Wilkesbarre selling reliable
goods at rock-bottom figures! Don&rsquo;t be deceived
by rival concerns trying to obtain a bit of
our well-earned prosperity! Come right in and be
convinced!&rdquo; And he kept on in this strain for fully
five minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is what I call downright mean,&rdquo; cried
Matt to Andy. &ldquo;Of course all these cracks at rival
concerns are meant for us. He wants to draw the
crowd away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that, he is trying to scare them, so
that if they won&rsquo;t patronize him they won&rsquo;t purchase
anywhere,&rdquo; returned the senior partner. &ldquo;It
is certainly not a fair way to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we stop, him, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how. He has mentioned no names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy began to talk, but as he was inside of the
store while Gissem was outside, very few of the
people on the street were attracted. They made
several sales to those inside, but after the purchasers
were gone the store was empty. In the meantime,
the next place was filled to overflowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us give them a tune,&rdquo; suggested Matt. &ldquo;I
see our rivals have no musical instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought out a banjo, and Andy took up the
largest accordion in the place. Sitting down in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
spot from which the music could float out of the
door, they played several of their best selections.</p>
<p>The music pleased many people. They stopped
listening to Gissem, and after some hesitation several
came in. More followed, and seeing this, Matt and
Andy kept on until the store was once more filled.</p>
<p>Then Matt began to talk. He made no wild
statements, but in an earnest manner told what they
had to sell, and asked those around him to examine
the goods carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow next door said to beware of rival
concerns,&rdquo; remarked a man in the crowd slyly, and
several smiled at the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I take it that people are bright enough to
know what they are doing,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;We
are too busy to talk about our neighbors. We are
here to show what we have and sell goods&mdash;if we
can. We do not misrepresent, and if any one is dissatisfied
with his purchase he can return it and get
his money back. Isn&rsquo;t that fair enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We carry a large stock, as you can see, and we
sell everything for what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see those spoons, will you?&rdquo; questioned
a man standing beside the one talking to Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir,&rdquo; and the young auctioneer handed
over several samples.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are these triple plated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; they are single plated, on white
metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they are just as good as triple plated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost as good, for ordinary wear. Here are
some that are triple plated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know all about spoons, for I used to be
in the plating business. I only asked to see what
you would say. That man next door tried to sell
my friend some single plated ones for triple plated.
I brought him in here to see what you had to say
about your stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have not misrepresented, have I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you have told the exact truth. John, if
you want any spoons, you might as well buy them
here, for I see they are put at a very reasonable
figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this, the man who had first spoken began to
pick out some of the goods. What his friend had
said had been heard by the crowd, who now began
to feel more like trusting in what the young auctioneers
might have to say.</p>
<p>Matt sold the spoons, and in the meantime Andy
put up a number of other articles at auction, and
sold them at fairly good prices.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>They managed to keep busy until two o&rsquo;clock in
the afternoon, when trade fell off once more. Seeing
this, Andy prepared to go out to dinner. He
had just put on his hat when Gissem, the rival
auctioneer, rushed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, I want to talk to you two fellows!&rdquo;
he blustered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; questioned Matt, as coolly as
he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been telling people I tried to stick a
man on a lot of tin-plated spoons, saying they were
solid silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind who said so. Let me tell you I
ain&rsquo;t going to stand such work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but we circulated no such story,&rdquo;
interrupted Andy. &ldquo;We know enough to mind our
own business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they told me one or the other of you had
said so. We won&rsquo;t stand that&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have you arrested
for&mdash;for defamation of character!&rdquo; stormed
the rival auctioneer, working himself up into a fine
pitch of assumed indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have said nothing concerning you,&rdquo; said
Matt. &ldquo;We have not even advised people to beware
of our rivals, nor have we mentioned your stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
in Bethlehem, and how the folks of that town
regarded your doings there,&rdquo; he went on pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; stammered Gissem,
taken by surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just what I infer. We know how people
there were swindled, and we know how anxious
some of them are to lay hands on a certain firm of
auctioneers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care, boy, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; you&rsquo;ll see fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot bully me. Now that you have
taken the trouble to come in here, let me tell you
something. You just cast several reflections upon
our characters. That has got to be stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Why, you are but a boy and dare
talk to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, he knows what he is saying,&rdquo; put
in Andy. &ldquo;We are not to be mistreated by rivals
or by any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me!&rdquo; snapped Gissem, and unable
to keep up the talk with credit to himself, he fled
from the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will dare to bother us again,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;He is too much afraid to have his
past record raked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy went off to dinner, leaving Matt in sole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
charge. The snow had cleared away, but it was
still cold, and to keep himself warm, Matt went to
the rear of the establishment and got his overcoat.
He was just putting on the garment when a noise
near the show-window attracted his attention. He
ran forward, and saw that a thin stream of water
was coming down through the boards of the ceiling.
The water was splashing on some of the stock, and
unless it was speedily checked it would do a good
bit of damage.</p>
<p>Matt knew that the upper part of the building
was not occupied. In the rear of the store was a
door leading to the back hallway, and through this
he ran and started to go upstairs.</p>
<p>As he did so, somebody started to come down. It
was the boy who worked for the rival auctioneers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<h3>TOM INWOLD.</h3>
</div>
<p>As soon as the boy saw Matt he stopped short,
and then endeavored to retreat. But Matt was
coming up the steps in a tremendous hurry, and in
ten seconds he was close enough to the boy to catch
him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; cried the boy, badly frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; questioned Matt sternly,
and without waiting for a reply, forced the boy to
accompany him into the rooms.</p>
<p>A glance around revealed the cause of the flood
below. In one of the rooms was a sink with city
water. The water had been turned on full, and the
sink-holes stopped up with putty. The sink had
overflowed, and the water was running through
several cracks in the floor.</p>
<p>As rapidly as he could Matt turned off the faucet.
Then leaving the water still in the sink to the brim,
he dashed downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come with me and help me save my stock!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
he cried to the boy. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll hand you
over to the first policeman I can find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t have me arrested!&rdquo; howled the
boy, almost scared out of his wits by the threat.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean any harm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mean any harm? We&rsquo;ll see. Come
down now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, and then followed Matt into
the store. Here a portion of the stock had to be
removed, and then the young auctioneer set the
boy to work mopping up the water on the counter
and the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, please don&rsquo;t have me arrested, will you?&rdquo;
asked the boy, almost in tears over what he considered
a very serious predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be taught a lesson,&rdquo; returned
Matt severely. &ldquo;What put you up to the idea of
letting the water overflow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Mr. Gissem said. He was awful mad
after he was in here, and he told Mr. Fillow he
wished that you would burn out or that the water
pipes would burst and drown you out. Then he
asked me if I couldn&rsquo;t worry you a bit, and I said
I&rsquo;d try, and that&rsquo;s the truth of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that man ought to be cowhided!&rdquo; was
Matt&rsquo;s vigorous exclamation. &ldquo;Excuse me, but is
he any relation to you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Fillow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, neither of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you come to be traveling with
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s face took on a sober look, and he
swallowed something like a lump in his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I got tired of going to school and I ran away
from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; Matt stopped short as
a certain thought flashed over his mind. &ldquo;Say, is
your name Tom Inwold, and do you come from
Plainfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this unexpected question the boy looked at
Matt in amazement, his mouth wide open, and his
eyes as big as they could well be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you who I was?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one; I guessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. We stopped in Plainfield a number
of weeks ago, and there I met your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo; faltered Tom Inwold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me that you had run away with an
auctioneer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and was that all?&rdquo; went on the boy, his
voice trembling with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she was very anxious to have you come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
home again. She missed you very much, and she
could not understand how you could have the heart
to leave her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words, which Matt delivered very
seriously, the tears sprang into Tom Inwold&rsquo;s eyes.
Evidently he was not hard-hearted, and had been
led astray purely by bad associates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wish I was back home again,&rdquo; he said in a
low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not like being an auctioneer&rsquo;s helper,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I might like you, but Gissem and
Fillow treat me awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place they don&rsquo;t half feed
me, and then they don&rsquo;t pay me the wages they
promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they promise you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollars a week to start on, and ten dollars
when I was worth it. I&rsquo;ve been with them a long
time, but I was never able to get a cent out of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing you had the money, would you go
home?&rdquo; asked Matt kindly, for he saw that the
boy&rsquo;s better feelings had been touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I would dare. Ma might whip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
me and have me sent to the reform school, or something
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she would&mdash;not if you promise to
turn over a new leaf. I should think you would
rather go home than remain where you have to
work for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I would go home if I had a railroad
ticket and some clothes fit to wear. You can see
how this suit looks,&rdquo; and Tom Inwold showed up
his ragged elbows and patched trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if I can do something for you,&rdquo; said
Matt.</p>
<p>When Andy came back he told his partner Tom
Inwold&rsquo;s story. To this the boy himself added the
tale of his hardships while with the rival auctioneers,
and added that he was very sorry he had
endeavored to do any injury to the stock in the
store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he means it,&rdquo; said Matt, as he and
Andy walked a little to one side. &ldquo;And I would
like to do something for the lad, for his mother&rsquo;s
sake as much as his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can fix it,&rdquo; replied Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
a talk with this Gissem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to pay the boy something for his
work.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he will&mdash;when I tell him that he is
liable to arrest for enticing the boy from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy told Tom Inwold to accompany him to the
store next door. At first the boy hung back, but
when Andy promised that he would take the responsibility
of the coming interview entirely upon his
own shoulders, the lad consented to go along.</p>
<p>They were gone nearly an hour, and during that
time Matt heard some pretty loud talking through
the partition which separated the two stores. But
when Andy and Tom Inwold came back he saw by
their faces that they had triumphed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first Gissem was in for facing me down,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;Said he had nothing to do with the boy,
and all that. But I threatened him with immediate
arrest, and promised to have the mother of the boy
here to testify against him, and then he weakened,
and at length gave Tom thirty dollars, with which
to buy a new suit of clothes, a pair of shoes, a hat,
and a railroad ticket, upon conditions that he would
not be prosecuted. I reckon he was badly scared,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt was much pleased. Leaving Andy in charge
of the store, he went out to dinner, taking Tom Inwold
along with him. After the meal the wearing
apparel was purchased and donned, and then they
made their way to the depot. Here a ticket for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
Plainfield was procured, and the young auctioneer
saw to it that the boy boarded the proper train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget you, never,&rdquo; said Tom Inwold
on parting, and he never has, nor has Mrs. Inwold,
who was grateful to the last degree for what Matt
had been instrumental in doing for her.</p>
<p>On the following morning, on going down to the
store to open up, Andy and Matt saw that the entire
stock of the store adjoining had been removed during
the night. Gissem had been fearful of trouble,
despite what Andy had promised, and had taken
time by the forelock, and left for parts unknown.
The young auctioneers never met him or his partner
again.</p>
<p>By having the entire field to themselves the young
auctioneers did a splendid business, and when they
were ready to pack up and start for Scranton they
found that they had cleared nearly ninety dollars
by their stay in Wilkes-Barre.</p>
<p>In the meantime the weather had been growing
steadily colder, and they found it necessary to invest
in a second-hand robe to keep them warm when
driving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks a bit like snow,&rdquo; remarked Andy, as
they drove out of the city one morning. &ldquo;I hope
we don&rsquo;t catch it before we reach where we are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
going to. A snowstorm in the mountains is not a
very pleasant thing to encounter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must run our chances,&rdquo; returned Matt, and
Billy was urged forward, and soon the city outskirts
were left far behind.</p>
<p>The sun had shone for awhile, but about nine
o&rsquo;clock it went under a heavy cloud. Then it began
to get slightly warmer, and Andy was certain
that snow was coming.</p>
<p>His prediction was fulfilled. By ten o&rsquo;clock it
was snowing furiously, and by eleven the ground
was covered to the depth of half a foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it; we can&rsquo;t make Scranton to-day,
nor even Pittston,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;We had better
hunt up some sort of a house with a barn attached,
where we can put up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Andy was for continuing the journey, so onward
they went, until at last, just before the noon
hour, they found the road getting too heavy for
Billy. They went down into a hollow which the
falling snow had covered, and there the wagon
remained, despite every effort to budge it.</p>
<p>They looked around in some dismay. Not even
a house nor a building of any sort was in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty pickle,&rdquo; muttered Andy. &ldquo;I
wish we had followed your advice and sought
shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to do something,&rdquo; returned Matt.
&ldquo;If we stay here we&rsquo;ll be completely snowed under.
The snow is coming down thicker every minute.
What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! what was to be done? That was a question
not easy to answer. Both of the young auctioneers
were much disturbed.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXVI_LOST_IN_THE_SNOW' id='CHAPTER_XXXVI_LOST_IN_THE_SNOW'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h3>LOST IN THE SNOW.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was not a pleasant outlook, stuck in a deep
hollow on the road with the snow coming down
furiously. Already the ground was covered to the
depth of a foot or more, and around the heavily-laden
wagon a drift was forming which soon
reached above the axles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do something, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; muttered
Matt, as he sprang to Billy&rsquo;s head for at least the
fifth time. &ldquo;Come, old fellow, can&rsquo;t you stir it up
a bit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy ran to the back of the wagon and placed
his shoulder against the case there strapped on. But
though the two and Billy, the horse, did their best,
the auction wagon remained where it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; groaned Andy, as he stopped to
catch his breath. &ldquo;We are stuck as hard as if we
were planted here, and it looks as if we would have
to remain here for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must move on,&rdquo; returned Matt desperately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
&ldquo;In a few hours night will be coming on, and we&rsquo;ll
be completely covered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow is coming down faster than ever, and
the wind is rising. Maybe we are going to have a
blizzard. If we do, Heaven help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take those cases of goods off,&rdquo; suggested
the young auctioneer after a moment of thought.
&ldquo;That will lighten the load for Billy somewhat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big packing boxes were unstrapped and let
down in the snow. They were followed by every
other article which could be removed from the turn-out
without damage.</p>
<p>Then Billy was once more urged to go on, Matt
and Andy pushing with all their strength in the
meanwhile. The wheels of the wagon and the
axles creaked and then moved forward slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! we&rsquo;ve got it started!&rdquo; shouted Matt
joyfully. &ldquo;Get up, Billy! get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the horse really did strain every muscle
until, two minutes later, the wagon was out of the
hollow and up on the ridge of a little hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank fortune we are out of that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Andy. &ldquo;Now what is to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better strap the cases in place again and
continue on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cases are awfully heavy. I wonder if we
can&rsquo;t hide them somewhere and come back for them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
later? The snow is not melting, so that won&rsquo;t hurt
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over, and finally they
decided to leave the two cases, which had not been
opened, and were well packed, under a big tree near
the roadside. The cases were removed to the spot
without delay, placed upon a couple of dead trees
and covered with brush.</p>
<p>Then they moved on again, Andy leading the
horse, and Matt going on ahead to inspect the road,
and thus avoid getting into another hollow.</p>
<p>It was bitterly cold, and having nothing but a
light overcoat on, the young auctioneer was chilled
to the bone. He was compelled to caper about and
clap his hands continually to keep from being
frozen. The snow, now fine and hard, beat into his
face mercilessly, and to protect himself from this
he pulled his hat far down over his eyes, and tied
his handkerchief over his mouth and nose.</p>
<p>But the hardships of the storm were not to be
endured for long. A quarter of a mile further on
they came to a large farmhouse, situated some little
distance back from the road. In the rear was a
barn and a cow-shed.</p>
<p>Running ahead, Matt knocked upon the door of
the house. It was opened by an elderly farmer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
who was smoking, and who held a paper in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-afternoon,&rdquo; said the young auctioneer.
&ldquo;Can we get shelter here for ourselves and our
horse? We are willing to pay for the accommodation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Caught on the road?&rdquo; returned
the farmer pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and Matt briefly narrated the particulars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive right around to the barn,&rdquo; were the farmer&rsquo;s
welcome words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open up for you and make
your horse comfortable enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And reaching for his hat and coat, he put them
on and came outside.</p>
<p>Andy was not slow to drive Billy into shelter.
The barn was a large one, and far from filled, and
the wagon went in without difficulty.</p>
<p>As soon as the horse had been cared for, the
young auctioneers followed the farmer back to the
house. The family had just finished their dinner,
but set to work at once to prepare food for the
half-frozen and exhausted travelers.</p>
<p>While Matt and Andy were warming up they
told the farmer about the cases which had been left
on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they ought not to be left there too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
long,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;If I had a light wagon and a
pair of strong horses I would go after them as soon
as I&rsquo;ve had something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind; I&rsquo;ll go after &rsquo;em for you,&rdquo; said
the farmer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Sam and Bess, and they can
pull through most anything. Perhaps after you&rsquo;ve
had dinner it will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you get them we will pay you whatever
it is worth,&rdquo; returned Matt&rsquo;s partner.</p>
<p>The farmer set about the trip without delay, and
just as Andy and Matt were called to the dining-table
he drove out of the yard.</p>
<p>The meal was a good one, there being plenty to
eat and all of it well served. To the two half-famished
ones it seemed to be about the best meal
they had ever tasted.</p>
<p>After it was over they sat down by the fire and
began to chat with the farmer&rsquo;s wife, a motherly
creature of the same age as her husband. Every
five minutes Matt would walk to the window to see
if the farmer was yet returning.</p>
<p>It was nearly an hour before Mr. Pearsall, for
such was the farmer&rsquo;s name, drove up to the door.
Matt and Andy ran out to meet him, and were
relieved to learn that the cases of goods had been
brought in good condition. They were taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
around to the barn and there transferred to their
original places on the auction wagon.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearsall was curious to know something of
their business, and when they were once more in
the house the two young auctioneers told their
story, to which both the farmer and his wife
listened with deep interest.</p>
<p>As it continued to snow, Matt and Andy decided
to remain at the farmhouse over night, and arrangements
were made to that effect. They spent a
pleasant evening, and all hands retired early.</p>
<p>In the morning, much to their joy, they found
that the snow had stopped coming down, and that
the sun was shining brightly. They had an early
breakfast, and then, after settling with Mr. Pearsall,
who did not wish cash, but took goods his wife
desired instead, they set off for Pittston, which was
scarcely half a mile distant.</p>
<p>Billy had had a good rest, and the city mentioned
above was reached in a short while. Here they
arranged for an extra horse, that was hitched up in
front of their own. In this manner they started
for Scranton with more confidence.</p>
<p>The road was as rocky and uneven as before, but
it being bright and clear, they were enabled to
avoid hollows with ease. They stopped at Taylor
for dinner, and arrived in Scranton an hour before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
nightfall, tired out, but happy to think that their
journey, for the balance of the week at least, was
over.</p>
<p>As soon as they had settled in a vacant store
Matt left Andy in charge and hurried to the post-office,
to look for a letter from Ida Bartlett. He
was not disappointed; the letter was there, and he
read it with deep interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since receiving your letter,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;I have
been watching Mr. Fenton closely, and I am satisfied
that he is much disturbed over the fact that
Mr. Gaston has left his employ and that he was
threatened with exposure. I have also taken the
liberty to write to Mr. Gaston, but have, as yet,
received no reply. Will write again as soon as he
answers. It is a pity you cannot find out what
became of your poor father and the papers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<h3>MORE OF AUCTION LIFE.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would give every cent I am worth, and
more, to learn what did become of father,&rdquo; said
Matt to Andy, after he had allowed his partner to
peruse the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt you would, Matt,&rdquo; returned
Andy feelingly. &ldquo;I can imagine how much it
worries you&mdash;not knowing if he is dead or alive.
But you must keep a stout heart and trust to the
future to clear up the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to do that, but, Andy, it&rsquo;s hard
work,&rdquo; and Matt&rsquo;s handsome face took on an unusually
sober look.</p>
<p>Knowing that nothing could be gained by discussing
the matter, which had been talked over a
score of times previously, Andy changed the subject.
Business had opened very well, and he wished
to go out and have some circulars printed, by which
even a larger crowd might be attracted to the sale.</p>
<p>It remained clear for two days, and during that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
time both of the young auctioneers were kept busy
from eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning until eleven at
night.</p>
<p>On the third day it began to grow warmer, and
by noon it was raining steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind, the rain will wash the snow
away, and if it only stays clear afterward we will
have a chance to get on to Carbondale,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s
cheerful comment.</p>
<p>Seeing that Matt could get along very well alone,
he left the store in the afternoon to buy a heavy
overcoat at some clothing establishment. If he
procured what he wished, Matt was to buy one also.</p>
<p>Left to himself, the young auctioneer did what he
could to attract trade, but without success. He
waited on the few customers who had drifted
in, but when they were gone found himself
alone.</p>
<p>Rather than have the time hang heavily upon his
hands he began to clean up the stock. Cutlery and
spoons need constant care to keep them looking
bright, and Matt was, therefore, never at a loss for
employment.</p>
<p>While he was hard at work shining up some
silver-plated ware which was slightly tarnished
through handling, the door of the store was flung
open violently, and a large, heavily-built man staggered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
in. At a glance Matt saw that the man was
much the worse for the liquor he had drunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is this an auction store?&rdquo; grunted the man,
as he tried to walk up to the counter with some
show of steadiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; returned the young auctioneer briefly.
Of all persons to deal with he hated a drunken man
the worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, hey&mdash;a genuine auction store?&rdquo; went on
the tipsy individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What can I do for you?&rdquo; and Matt put
the silverware he was handling away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to buy a pistol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt was surprised at this statement, and he <a name='TC_5'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'was was'">was</ins>
also alarmed. The tipsy man was certainly not
the person to have a firearm in his possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish a pistol?&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, boy! Hand out the best pistol you
have in the place! I don&rsquo;t want any toy pop-gun
remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man glared at Matt as though the boy
were his one personal enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, but I hardly think I have a pistol to
suit you,&rdquo; replied the young auctioneer, thinking it
best to discourage the man if possible. &ldquo;You had
better go to a regular firearms store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-going nowhere but here!&rdquo; growled the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
would-be customer, as he gave a lurch against the
counter. &ldquo;I want a pistol; best you got, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, but I haven&rsquo;t any pistol for you,&rdquo;
Matt replied steadily. He wished Andy would
come back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you mean to say you refuse to sell
me a pistol?&rdquo; howled the man savagely. &ldquo;Let me
tell you, boy, that I have ample means for reimbursing
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any pistol for you, sir. You had
better go elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t go, understand, I won&rsquo;t go! Let me see
them pistols in that show-case, and be quick about
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt was now growing alarmed. The man was
just intoxicated enough to be thoroughly ugly, and
might try to do him harm should he refuse the
request which had been made. Yet he realized
more than ever that the man was not the one to be
trusted with a firearm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care to show you the pistols,&rdquo; was all
the young auctioneer could say. &ldquo;You must go
elsewhere if you wish one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t sell me one, hey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have my reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully smart, boy; most too smart to
live! But I am going to have what I want, understand
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With unsteady steps the man walked to the rear
end of the counter and came around to the inner
side. He was met by Matt, who, becoming alarmed,
had picked up the butt-end of a fishing-rod with
which to defend himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come back here, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you cannot. The best thing you can do is
to go elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! do you threaten me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to understand that you cannot come
back here. I told you I did not wish to sell you a
pistol, and that ought to be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to fight, boy?&rdquo; demanded the man,
scowling savagely and doubling up his fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not wish to fight. I merely wish to
be left alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt had hardly spoken when the tipsy man
hurled himself forward, intending to catch the
young auctioneer by the throat. But Matt was
too quick for him. He stepped backward, and the
consequence was that the man went headlong,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
striking the floor with such force that every article
in the store shook and rattled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you young villain!&rdquo; panted the tipsy
man, as he attempted to rise to his feet. &ldquo;What
do you mean by such conduct? Help me up, do
you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear, but I am not going to assist you until
you promise to leave at once,&rdquo; returned Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look at those pistols first,&rdquo; growled
the intoxicated one, and by holding fast to the
counter he managed, but not without much difficulty,
to rise to his feet once more. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine
way to treat a gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your own fault. You had no business to
try to catch me by the throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had no business to be saucy, understand,
boy, saucy? I never allow any one to be
saucy to me. Now them pistols, and no more
nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of replying, Matt tried to push the man
out from behind the counter. The young auctioneer
thought that if he could get him out near the
door he would then be able to summon assistance
and have the tipsy individual taken away.</p>
<p>Evidently the man suspected his intention. He
declined to be pushed back, and seeing what he
considered a good chance, he hurled himself at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
Matt once more, and this time both rolled to the
floor.</p>
<p>In going down, the young auctioneer struck his
head upon the sharp corner of a box. He was
partly stunned, and for several seconds could not
make a movement in his own favor. The piece of
the fishing-rod flew out of his hand, and this his
opponent picked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you to talk to a gentleman like myself!&rdquo;
growled the tipsy man, and he aimed a blow
at the young auctioneer&rsquo;s head with the weapon he
had secured.</p>
<p>The blow failed to reach its mark, but undismayed
by his failure to injure Matt, the man
gathered himself together and prepared for a second
attack.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXVIII_A_SURPRISING_DISCOVERY' id='CHAPTER_XXXVIII_A_SURPRISING_DISCOVERY'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<h3>A SURPRISING DISCOVERY.</h3>
</div>
<p>It looked as if the young auctioneer was in for a
serious time of it. As has been said, the would-be
purchaser of a pistol was just drunk enough to be
ugly and unreasonable. He had refused to leave
the auction store, and now he was bent upon doing
mischief to the boy who had failed to treat him as
he fancied he ought to be served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how do you like that, you young rascal?&rdquo;
growled the man, as he brought the end of the fishing-rod
down for a second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it at all,&rdquo; returned Matt, as he recovered
sufficiently to dodge out of the way,
although the stick came uncomfortably close to his
ears. &ldquo;Let me up at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, boy, not much! I&rsquo;m going to teach
you a lesson to be civil to customers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are getting yourself into serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! I reckon I am able to take care of
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>Once again the man sought to strike Matt, and
this time he succeeded. The blow landed upon the
young auctioneer&rsquo;s shoulder, and caused him to cry
out with pain.</p>
<p>At that instant the door opened, and Andy
entered the store, carrying on his arm the new
overcoat he had just purchased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Matt?&rdquo; he cried, in quick
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me, Andy! This drunken man is trying
to knock me out with that stick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The senior partner of the firm needed no second
call for assistance. Without hesitation he flung the
overcoat on a packing case, and rushing up to Matt&rsquo;s
assailant, caught him by the collar and dragged him
from behind the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me&mdash;me go!&rdquo; spluttered the tipsy individual.
&ldquo;Let go my collar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it, Andy!&rdquo; and Matt sprang to
his feet as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to,&rdquo; was Andy&rsquo;s determined
answer. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t let me look at the pistols,&rdquo; whined
the tipsy man, collapsing now that he saw he was
powerless to do any more injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think he was in fit condition to look at
anything,&rdquo; put in Matt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You had no right to abuse my partner,&rdquo; said
Andy, sure that Matt was in the right of the altercation.
&ldquo;Now you get right out of here, and don&rsquo;t
show your face again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Andy shoved the man toward the door,
which he had left partly open.</p>
<p>The tipsy man began to remonstrate, and wanted
to fight both of them. He grew quite abusive, and
threatened to wreck all the things in the establishment.
Before he could carry out his threat, however,
Andy and Matt landed him out on his back on
the sidewalk and beckoned to a passing policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! so it&rsquo;s you again!&rdquo; cried the officer, on
seeing the intoxicated individual. &ldquo;I thought you
had warning enough at the hotel. What has he
been doing?&rdquo; he asked of Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got mad because I wouldn&rsquo;t let him handle
the pistols in the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pistols?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. He insisted upon seeing the best pistol
we had, and I wouldn&rsquo;t accommodate him. I thought
it might be dangerous. Of course he would want
cartridges, and then he might go off and shoot somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was his intention. He got into a row in
the hotel on the next block, and the clerk says he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
threatened to shoot the proprietor. I suppose he
was bent on getting the pistol to do it with. Just
you come with me, and I&rsquo;ll give you a chance to
sober up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tipsy man remonstrated, and tried to make
the policeman believe that the rows at the hotel and
at the store were only jokes. But the officer would
not listen, and took the drunken individual to the
station-house, where, later on, he was sentenced to
thirty days in the county jail for disturbing the
peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another side of the auction business,&rdquo; said
Matt, after he and Andy were left alone. &ldquo;And I
must confess it&rsquo;s a side I don&rsquo;t like. It was lucky
you came along when you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An intoxicated man never makes a good customer,
Matt. Some store-keepers try to get his
money away from him, but, as for me, I want nothing
to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blow on the shoulder had not injured Matt,
and soon the incident, exciting as it had been, was
almost forgotten. Andy had struck a bargain, as
he termed it, in the purchase of his new overcoat,
and he wished Matt to go off at once and get one
like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are selling about two dozen off at bottom
price,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you want to lose no time if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
you wish to get fitted. It is the first store on the
third block above here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go, Andy, for I can&rsquo;t do without
the overcoat,&rdquo; and off Matt started, never once
dreaming of what was going to happen on that
simple little shopping trip.</p>
<p>Matt located the clothing shop without difficulty.
It was quite well filled with customers, but he soon
found the salesman who had served Andy, and this
young man did not keep him waiting any longer
than was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>There were three overcoats which just fitted
Matt, and he hesitated as to which to take. He
tried them all on, but could not decide the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take them to the daylight and examine
them,&rdquo; he said, and walked from the center of the
store, which was lighted by gas, toward the show
window.</p>
<p>Here he began to examine each overcoat critically.
One was black, the other brown, and third a dark
blue. Matt rather fancied the dark blue.</p>
<p>While he was handling over the dark-blue coat,
the form of a ragged man darkened the side of the
show window furthest from the door. With hardly
a thought, Matt looked up to see who it was.</p>
<p>Then the heart of the young auctioneer seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
to fairly stop beating. The ragged man on the
pavement outside was <i>his father</i>!</p>
<p>With a sharp cry that startled every one in the
establishment, Matt dashed down the garments he
held and made a rush for the door. At the same
moment the man outside, catching one glimpse of
Matt&rsquo;s face, put up both his hands to his forehead
and sped up the street as if running for his life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with that young fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, come back here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he steal anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and a score of other cries rang out in quick
succession. But Matt paid no attention, nor did he
stop to offer any explanation to the astonished
clothing salesman. He had seen his father, his
father for whom he had been searching so long and
so earnestly! He could tell that face, as haggard
and white as it was, among a million.</p>
<p>Away sped the man up the street, and on after
him came Matt, running as he had never run before.
He could not understand why his parent should
thus try to get away from him. But he did not
stop to reason on the matter. He wanted to reach
his father, that was all, and he strained every muscle
to accomplish his effort.</p>
<p>But although Matt was a good runner, the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
he was after appeared well able to keep beyond his
reach. Evidently some dreadful fear urged him on,
for many times he would look back over his shoulder,
and each time pass his hands over his forehead,
as if to wipe the sight from his brain and memory.</p>
<p>Soon several blocks had been passed, and then the
man turned a corner, and started toward the poorer
section of the city. Matt continued to follow for
half a dozen blocks further. Then he saw his father
dart into the open hallway of a half-tumbled-down
tenement.</p>
<p>When he reached the building the young auctioneer
peered into the hallway, but could see no one.
Several little girls were playing upon the sidewalk,
and he asked them if they had seen any one go in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy Will just went in,&rdquo; replied one of the
girls. &ldquo;Guess he has gone up to his room in the
garret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy Will!&rdquo; murmured Matt to himself.
&ldquo;Poor father! How thankful I am that I have
found you at last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And trembling with emotion, he hurried up the
rickety stairs until he reached the door of the apartment
which one of the girls pointed out as that
occupied by Crazy Will.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<h3>A MYSTERY CLEARED UP.</h3>
</div>
<p>The door of the garret room was closed, and
when Matt tried the knob, he found that it was also
locked. He knocked lightly upon it.</p>
<p>At first there was no response. Then a weak
voice, which he could but faintly recognize as that
of his father, asked sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? What do you want? Why
don&rsquo;t you go away and leave me alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! father! come and open the door!&rdquo; exclaimed
Matt, his voice trembling as it had never
trembled before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who speaks? Go away, I say, and leave a poor
old man alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, it is me, Matt! Don&rsquo;t you remember
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matt! Matt! Oh, no, Matt was lost when his
mother was lost and the money! Yes, the money,
mother, and Matt! Too bad! Go away, and don&rsquo;t
persecute me!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, you are mistaken. I am here,
father&mdash;your only son, Matt. Please open the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are fooling me! Didn&rsquo;t you fool me about
Matt only last week and throw a pail of water on
me, and call me Crazy Will? Go away, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, I will not go away! You must open
the door! You <i>must</i>! I have been hunting for
you so long&mdash;ever since mother died and you disappeared,
and now that I have found you, we shall
never separate again. Open the door; do, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words, spoken with an intensity which cannot
be described, had the necessary effect upon the
poor, weak-minded man inside of the garret room.
Matt heard him move slowly toward the door, and
then heard the key turn in the lock. The next
instant the door opened, and the boy sprang into
the room and caught his father around the neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo; he cried, with
deep emotion. &ldquo;It is Matt, your only son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked his father steadily in the eyes, the
tears meanwhile coursing freely down his cheeks.
Mr. Lincoln returned the gaze for a moment, then
the wild look died out of his eyes, and his breast
heaved and he gave a deep sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matt! Matt! It is really you! My son! my
son!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>He caught the boy in his arms and hugged him
to his breast, sobbing the meanwhile like a little
child. He spoke of his wife and her death, of his
lost money, and a hundred other things, and then,
in the midst of it all, threw up his arms and sank to
the floor in a dead faint.</p>
<p>A less courageous boy than Matt would have been
badly scared. But he knew of these fainting spells,
for his father had had them years before and had
always come out of them feeling weaker in body, it
was true, but always clearer in mind.</p>
<p>In one corner of the room lay an old mattress,
and upon this he placed his father&rsquo;s form. Then
he opened the tightly-closed window and began to
bathe his father&rsquo;s forehead with some water that
stood in a cracked pitcher near by.</p>
<p>Two of the girls that had told him about Crazy
Will had followed him up the tenement stairs and
were now standing outside of the garret-room door,
staring at all that was going on. Matt called them
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do either of you want to earn twenty-five
cents?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked the older of the two girls
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to deliver a message for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>Matt mentioned the auction store and described
its location. The girl said she knew where it was
and would willingly take a message there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer want a doctor?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. You take this note and it will be all
right. But you must not lose a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run all the way,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>Taking out a notebook he carried, Matt hastily
scribbled down the following brief message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Andy</span>: I have found my father. Come with
the bearer at once.</p>
<p style='margin-left:8em;'><span class='smcap'>Matt</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This he folded up and addressed to his partner.
In another minute the girl was flying down the
tenement stairs, two steps at a time, the other girl
close behind her.</p>
<p>When they were gone Matt closed the door and
again turned his attention to his father.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s eyes were still closed, but by putting
his ear down to his parent&rsquo;s chest, Matt found
that his father was breathing quite regularly. He
continued to bathe his parent&rsquo;s forehead and
also fanned him with a newspaper which was lying
by.</p>
<p>While waiting for his father to come to again,
Matt could not help but gaze at the surroundings.
The garret room was small and bare of furniture,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
containing nothing but the mattress, a broken-down
stove, and a few cracked dishes. There was half a
loaf of stale bread beside the dishes, and nothing
else to eat was in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a place to live in!&rdquo; murmured the boy to
himself. &ldquo;Poor father! Poor father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He again bent over the motionless form, and it
was not long before he had the satisfaction of seeing
his father open his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matt, is it really you, or is this another one of
those tantalizing dreams?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lincoln
feebly, as he essayed to rise to a sitting position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really I, father,&rdquo; returned the son gently.
&ldquo;You had better lie still for awhile. Your run exhausted
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thankful I am that it is really you! But
there must be some mistake. I have dreamed of
these things before. That is why I ran away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no mistake now, father, it is really and
truly I,&rdquo; and Matt bent lower and wound his arms
around his father&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;You have nothing more
to fear, father. Just rely on me for everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Matt, I will! I know it is you, now that
you are so close to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, father, you must promise that you will not
run away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise, Matt. My mind was upset&mdash;it&rsquo;s upset
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
yet, I&rsquo;m afraid. But I won&rsquo;t leave you, Matt;
I won&rsquo;t leave you. I used to imagine I saw you,
and then the boys on the street would plague me
and call me Crazy Will. But that&rsquo;s all over now,
thank Heaven! That&rsquo;s all over now!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<h3>THE MINING SHARES&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h3>
</div>
<p>In less than half an hour Andy reached the garret
room, and Matt told his partner his story. Andy
was introduced to Mr. Lincoln as a friend who
could be trusted in all things, and although the
weak-minded man was suspicious of all strangers,
he made no demonstration against his son&rsquo;s companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to take him to some quiet place, where
he can have the best of medical attention,&rdquo; said
Matt to Andy. &ldquo;Do you think you can find such a
place? I do not dare to leave him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do my best,&rdquo; returned Andy.</p>
<p>He went off in search of the right place, and in
an hour came back, accompanied by a pleasant man
fifty or sixty years of age, whom he introduced as
Dr. Zabrinsky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor will take your father into his own
home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has two patients suffering
from mental troubles and makes a specialty of such
things. He will do his best.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>Matt was pleased by the medical man&rsquo;s appearance,
and after some little conversation, a carriage
was called, and Mr. Lincoln was removed, accompanied
by Matt, to the doctor&rsquo;s private sanitarium.
Andy was left behind to go over Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s
meager effects and bring away anything of value.</p>
<p>At the doctor&rsquo;s home the almost helpless man was
made as comfortable as possible. He was inclined
to become excited over what had happened, but the
doctor administered an opiate, and he soon after
sank into a gentle slumber.</p>
<p>When Andy reached the house some time later
his face betoken that he had something of unusual
interest to tell. He bore a package of papers in his
hand, and these he handed over to Matt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found then stuck in the mattress,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They are papers in reference to the mining shares
your father purchased from Randolph Fenton. From
what you have told me, I believe Fenton swindled
your father. As soon as your father is well enough
to be left I would send for that Mr. Gaston and
have the matter looked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt examined the papers with keen interest.
He became satisfied that Andy was right, and determined
to act upon his suggestions.</p>
<p>Dr. Zabrinsky was true to his word. He did all
that was possible for the sufferer, and between his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
medical skill and Matt&rsquo;s watchful care, Mr. Lincoln
recovered rapidly. Once in a great while his mind
would take on a flighty turn, but Matt was watchful
and always calmed him down, and at the end of
six months the man whose mind had been so
strangely affected was as rational and well as ever.</p>
<p>Long before this time Matt made a trip to New
York and called upon Ida Bartlett at her new place
of business. They had a long conversation concerning
Randolph Fenton and his methods of selling
stocks and shares.</p>
<p>At the end of this talk Matt made inquiries concerning
Mr. Gaston&rsquo;s whereabouts. He learned
that the former clerk was in Bridgeport, Connecticut,
and telegraphed that he wished to see him without
delay. On the following Friday morning Mr. Gaston
presented himself at the hotel at which Matt
was stopping.</p>
<p>The young auctioneer went over his entire story
and produced the papers which had been in his
father&rsquo;s possession. He promised Gaston a liberal
reward should they succeed in forcing Randolph
Fenton to make proper restitution for a transaction
that was undoubtedly criminal upon its face.</p>
<p>The old book-keeper at once consented to do what
he could. He called in a lawyer of thorough experience,
and several affidavits were made out, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
search made for Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s rightful shares, for the
ones Randolph Fenton had assigned to him had
been some of a similar name but of far less value.
Then all hands marched down to the broker&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Randolph Fenton was somewhat surprised to see
Matt, and he turned slightly pale when Gaston confronted
him, accompanied by the lawyer and another
man he knew was a private detective.</p>
<p>Without preliminaries, the lawyer explained the
object of the visit. As he proceeded the broker
grew paler and paler, and he clutched the arms of
his chair nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are mistaken!&rdquo; he finally gasped out.
&ldquo;That transaction was perfectly legitimate. This
is a plot on the part of that man and that boy to
ruin my reputation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no plot, Mr. Fenton,&rdquo; put in Matt. &ldquo;For
my poor father&rsquo;s sake as well as my own, I ask for
justice; that is all. Your actions unbalanced my
father&rsquo;s mind, and if I wanted to be hard-hearted I
would not rest until you were behind the prison
bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense! This is all a put-up
job&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, Mr. Fenton,&rdquo; said the lawyer
pointedly. &ldquo;The boy is letting you down very
easily, to my way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Tut-tut! I won&rsquo;t listen to a word! I want you
all to leave this office and stop this farce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have to leave without satisfaction you
will go with Mr. Briarly, the detective,&rdquo; cried Matt.
&ldquo;Now you can take your choice. I am no longer
your office boy, and you cannot twist me around
your finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words filled Randolph Fenton with rage.
He wanted to abuse everybody within hearing, but
both the lawyer and the detective cut him short by
threatening him with immediate arrest. Finally he
asked for time in which to consider the case.</p>
<p>This was granted, but after they left Matt instructed
the detective to keep a close watch on the
man, fearful that Fenton, who, according to Mr.
Gaston&rsquo;s statement, was in bad favor in a number of
places, would convert what securities he held into
cash and leave for parts unknown.</p>
<p>It was well that Matt did this, for on the following
night the detective captured the broker just as
the latter was boarding a train at the Grand Central
depot. He had a satchel full of money with
him, and in his card case was found a railroad ticket
for Montreal, Canada. Randolph Fenton was placed
under arrest, and then all of his many misdeeds
were thoroughly investigated and exposed.</p>
<p>Out of the wreckage the swindling broker had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
left behind him Matt was able to secure three-fourths
of the rightful shares of mining stock for
his father. These shares had gone up in value and
were found to be worth close on to fifty-eight thousand
dollars. To Matt, who, in his wanderings
around, had learned the true value of money, it
seemed a fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t want any more of the auction business,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;You will have your hands full
taking care of that money and your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess my days as a young auctioneer are
over,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;I want to get a better education
if possible, and thus fit myself for something
higher in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your share in the business? I can&rsquo;t
buy it out just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have talked it over with father, Andy, and I
have decided to make you a present of it. You deserve
it, for ever since we met you have been a real
brother to me. Make what you can out of the business,
and if you ever get in a tight corner don&rsquo;t
hesitate to come to me, and I will do what I can for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy demurred at Matt&rsquo;s generosity, but was
finally persuaded to accept the gift. He settled in
Middletown for the winter and did very well. In
the spring he started on his travels again, and by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
fall had made enough to open a good-sized picture
and art store in New York City on Fourteenth
street. He still runs the store and is making money
fast, much to the disgust of Caleb Gulligan, who
grows poorer each year.</p>
<p>After Matt left the auction business he settled
down with his father in a quiet home on the Hudson
River, not many miles above the great metropolis.
He took care of his father until the next autumn,
when Mr. Lincoln felt sufficiently recovered to go
into business, and purchased the controlling interest
in a large flour and feed establishment. The business
is very prosperous. Ida Bartlett is stenographer
and confidential clerk to the firm, and has a
well-paying position, which will remain open for
her so long as the kind-hearted young woman cares
to occupy it. Matt did not fail to keep his former
determination to give her a handsome Christmas
present, and the two are likely to be life-long friends.</p>
<p>As for Matt himself, he has just finished a course
at Columbia College, and next month will become
the junior partner in a promising young law firm.
Let us wish him every success, for the honest and
fearless lad who was once the Young Auctioneer
deserves it.</p>
